I really enjoyed my time with PwC on several engagement over the years. The company compensation based on my chosen employment arrangements were really attractive at the time. 
Demanding culture but that's to be expected. I find the work rewarding and the flexibility managing my schedule has been great. I'm on the technology side and have seen the company make huge investments in the past three years.
For public accounting (I've worked at both PwC and a mid-tier firm), PwC has great benefits for an accounting firm (excellent pay, good medical, lots of random gift cards and gifts on behalf of firm, great training). They have an average amount of PTO, but a very generous unlimited sick time. Average busy season was around 55 hours. 
I had a great, over performing team, and everyone was very helpful. Not my first big consulting firm, so when I accepted the position, I had a good understanding of the culture and high expectations. Great benefits, helpful teams - as long as you have a thorough understanding that they try to hire only the best, and expect nothing shortof that. Mediocre is never okay. For most, not a place to stay forever, but excellent experience, work ethic, and is impressive on a resume. Nothing negative, just be aware that being an over performer and everyone is a a “cog in the wheel,” so to speak. Nothing different from other top consulting companies.

Wonderful benefits and great perks but leadership has lost its way. We reinvent the wheel every single day and in the last few years, the company feels more and more chaotic.

Typical big accounting firm culture, room to grow but lots of hours you need to put in. Can be stressful. Benefits are good. Work life balance needs to be a focus

Pwc is a great place to start your career in the tax industry. You will learn a lot your first couple years. Be prepared to sacrifice your entire life to work for this company. Work life balance is non existent and they will work you to the bone if you let them. Remember to set your boundaries. 
Lots of stress and anxiety with this job. The department is extremely understaffed, and it just keeps getting worse. Looking to get out as soon as I can.
PwC is a great place to learn about alot of industries really fast. The drawbacks of this are sometimes long hours required to deliver on client needs.
Awesome Directors in consulting practice that encouraged me and provided support to advance my career. Unfortunately, I was laid off due to a slow down of projects. 
Busy season you learn a lot but the hours are super crazy. Also there is a lot of micromanaging from the seniors and the managers. Benefits are really nice though.
You have to find your own projects and compete with other associates to stay off the bench. Adds way too much stress to the work. I would go here for 2 years and then leave because the exit opportunities are great.

I spent nearly a decade at PwC. You definitely will learn a lot, but you get pigeonholed very quickly in Advisory. You are put into a vertical and horizontal right away, so unless you are very intentional about your path, you will likely only be staffed within your area. You're going to learn a lot and be challenged with many competing deadlines (which is a good skill in life). But it can be very difficult - especially in client services - to draw clear boundaries
Good environment to work at. People are nice and there are lot of opportunities for growth. Might have a lot of workload, but that is expected in a public accounting firm.

This is a good place to work with the right attitude and management. You can go to the moon here if you navigate the right people and don’t fall through the cracks
I learned a lot from the people and through the online courses that were offered.  When problems arose they were dealt with very professionally and fairly.  I learned to work as a team to meet the continued requirements and deadlines.  I worked well under pressure and was able to work overtime.
Good pllace to work for growth and learning. Lot's of hours and not a lot of support. Hard to sustain for more than a few years but overall good job. 
For accounting majors, PwC is a great starting point. But, if you are more ambitious than just willing to settle in financial reporting, it becomes more difficult to move to another finance jobs.
Great place for career advancement. Lots of structure. I generally know what to expect in terms of workload. Not the most exciting work but you learn a lot over time.
ProsClear structureConsBusy season
Great so far as I've only been here for 2 weeks. Onboarded smoothly and recruiting was pretty smooth as well. Engaged early and now getting pretty busy 
"Management was disorganized and extremely condescending. I should have known when I was recruited, interviewed and hired in a 2 hour time span that something was wrong with the position. I believe that they use a ""spaghetti against the wall"" approach in filling roles for large projects. They are trying to find as many accomplished people who are willing to work off the clock (as they frequently pressure contractors to do) and who will both accept condescension and deliver it to others. Very toxic environment. Assuming you use them, MBO takes way too much from your pay rate as well."
ProsProvides computerConsDisorganized and condescending
The leaders are great, organizes many connectivity events. Some teams are better than others. Very demanding, 70-80 hours per week during the busy season. 
"I was not a fan of the culture at all. Getting staffed on projects is easier said than done after one little mistake. Management holds grudges. A director actually told me once that I had a bad ""brand within the firm."""
Good start for your career. You get interesting projects and get to meet a lot of people. Your experience will depend on your team and their work style.

Enployer Really valued work life balance there. They Made sure employees were happy. Did not micromanage you, as long as you met deadlines you were okay 
My+ is preached heavily by leadership, but no one really seems to know what it is (other than a recruiting tactic).  Onboarding has been painful - long time spent 'on the bench' (not billable to client) which leads to me questioning my likelihood of remaining with the firm. 
ProsGood salary, some leadership seem to careConsVague assignments, folks 'too busy' to talk/help new joiners
Great place to work for! The learning curve is steep and people are willing to help. You will have to work long hours but that's how you learn! A great place to start off as fresh grads as you will learn how to work professionally 
Pros: ok culture hours dependent on projectpolitics not as cut throat as competitors Cons:ever changing direction from senior managers can-do attitude sometimes forces ppl to not voice out in hopes of not coming off as cherry picking
Good place to quickly learn the stuff and get your ready for the the next step of your career but no work and life balance, the training is so disappointing. You have to figure things out by yourself. 
Big 4 are overrated in school and in workplace.They say you learn a lot. But evey where  you learn a lot if u want to lean in general. You stress out too much, left in dark most of the time and you need to teach yourself, no work life balance. Reconsider before you get too excited.
The training can be improved. Upon being hired, there was alot of down time where no one had a set plan for the new hires to do. You had to be proactive to get work.
En busy season es realmente duro tener un equilibrio entre trabajo y vida personal, se hacen muchas horas extras pero el resto del año es más tranquilo. Trabajo flexible en cuanto a la presencialidad. Gran grupo humano
They need better training in tax department for new employees that just graduated from college. There wasn't much structure in the first few months and it felt like you had to figure things out for yourself or ask.

There was an arduous on boarding process with no help provided to navigate those  first critical  few weeks there.  My boss and this work experience was, by far, the worst of my career.
ProsBeautiful offices with easy access to an office from just about any locationConsThe partner in charge of my practice lacked leadership skills and abused her position, difficult to find other opportunities within company.

This is a great place to start your accounting career, however you can get burnt out quickly. The workload continues to increase, hours are getting longer, and the pay is not increasing at the same rate. You will work very long hours, but learn a ton.

I took a dat associate role at pwc expecting to be working with the technicals of Erp systems. They really made the role seem more technical then it was you do not touch any tech or code in this role. The entire role is looking at soc 1 and soc2 reports. This involves looking at the prior year evidence / documentation and copying it over for the current year with new names dates and evidence. The evidence comes in from kpi reports and your job is  confirming the names and dates match what was requested which is most likely the same thing that was requested last year. The control c control v meme about this role is real. I felt like the job was very tedious and boring. However if you’re an accountant with a accounting degree who wants to dip there toes in the water of tech I think this could be a great role for you. This is a it-AUDIT role emphasize on the audit because you do not touch the it side at all. If your a techie stay away go devops cyber or tech consultanting don’t fall for the same trap I did. I plan on moving out of this role very soon despite its benefits due to the banality of the work. Now if you want a easy work life balance light travel and don’t care about being a excel monkey this could be a good role. Realistically you work 40 hours a week and 55 hours during busy season for easy work and pretty good pay. The benefits are great medical dental and even legal plans they offer are fantastic. This work will definitely not stress you out you are literally just following steps from last year or that are already laid out. Useful tip at pwc keep in touch with your - more...
I loved working at PwC, it was an amazing experience and everyday felt different. There was such a great thing about working in a fast-paced environment. 
Management is smart but will cut you off at any second with zero regard. Everyday you will learn something new and the work is challenging which is rewarding. 
Just like every other big 4 firm the work life balance is brutal and your experience depends on which engagements you get staffed on and the managers you report to. The experience is great for your resume though.
Was ok but people want to be promoted so not the friendliest place to work. Dog eat dog environment. Management was a bit mixed some nice some not so nice
The hours are awful, especially during busy season, which depending on your industry could be every quarter. Teams are collaborative and you can learn about your clients and particular industries if you care to ask questions and pay attention. 
Great benefits and friendly work environment. As an intern, I had the opportunity to do actual work and provide value to the work being done. Great place to work 
work work work work, a lot of commitments and not paid fairly at the end, great environment though, however, middle east leadership is starting to recon the place. 
A lot of work more of a figure it yourself environment engagements will literally fight over you to get their work done everything is “priority” there 
Its hard to believe how people can work for brand purpose to a place like this. The salary levels are pathetic and the dress code and looks you need to maintain cost more.

Working at PwC is a great first job after college as it exposes you to various aspects of accounting. Most industry employers prefer or even require Big 4 experience when recruiting. People are great however turnover is a big issue with the hours worked.
Working at PwC is a great first job out of college. Learn a lot and great work environment, great people. The turnover is a real issue and they don't make it any easier on the people still there.
Do not allow employees to learn one job and be successful. Moves employees to multiple projects and less than a year and expects unattainable numbers. Quality does not matter to this company only quantity, no matter the quality. 
If you can follow your engagement partner and/or directors without voicing any complaints, then you're likely to succeed here and be promoted quickly.
Working with young and smart people is, the compensation and benefits are good, but non of those are worth going through the busy season. Clients' attitudes towards auditors are just unnecessary.

"Public accounting is not easy. You're going to have a bunch of clients and tight deadlines. At least PwC has the resources to draw from. ""Fast paced"" doesn't come close but if you're going into PA, go big 4."
I enjoyed documenting the Software Development / Application.The Tax Application was new to me and very interesting.  It was so easy to document, because I had the ability to learn as I captured the processes and Procedures.
Working here is the most stressful environment I’ve ever been in. The tools to do the job are not readily available and the lack of care from management is atrocious. The schedule is awesome however. And the pay is okay, but the lower you are on the totem pole the more work you do for less pay. 
ProsFlexible scheduleConsTraining. Assistance received.
Contractors are treated with disdain. Higher management is  arrogant, rude, and untrustworthy. Project length is misrepresented. (I was recruited for 7 months project that only lasted 2 months).  A lot of passive-aggressive behavior from upper management (Project Managers lie and never respond to inquiries). SHAME SHAME SHAME!!! 
ProsGood to have pwc on resume
There are so many wonderful things about working for the company. My favorite is probably the flexibility I have with my hours. I also love the company culture and enjoy working with everyone. A lot of employees love their jobs because it looks great on a resume and allows them to gain a lot of knowledge.
Out of 220 PwC employee reviews, 76% were positive. The remaining 24% were constructive reviews with the goal of helping PwC improve their work culture. The Operations team, with 86% positive reviews, reports the best experience at PwC compared to all other departments at the company. The IT team offered the most constructive feedback, with 29% of that department's reviews constructive in nature
If you're looking for a job in Big 4 accounting that you know will be there through any economic turmoil, this is for you. I can personally say through Covid that my job was secure. However, advancement with a company this large is inevitable to have some drawbacks culturally. If you are of the woke mindset, this is your place. If you think you want to disagree with anyone in that space of thought, expect to have your advancement slowed and have no life. Covid sending everyone home changed the atmosphere. My suggestion, get in to build the resume and get out.
The hours are long; at times it can be challenging, but it all helps you learn and grow your experience. Apart from that, PwC prides itself and promotes the culture of being the most prestigious out of the big 4
Excellent benefits, interesting work, smart and caring people. Truly trying to transform the culture to a people first model where employee well-being and growth drives business success.

My partner, managers and fellow staff worked well together. Always cared about and offered any help/suggestions to make our team work well together.  Training was available and extra projects if you wanted were available. I.miss working with the LKE team.
It’s a place for people who would like to do things by rules. You probably won’t have a so called work life balance here. However, the high turn over rate might give someone who stays a good chance to get promoted quickly

I feel very anxious about my work.I feel very less supportive at my work.There are new techs that are being assigned to me but I feel helpless when I work.Therefore it makes me less productive at work.
Great place to work! I really enjoyed the company culture and ability to grow in my position. I was a summer intern with PwC, and I had a great time interacting with fellow interns and my team.
This was the funnest job I have ever had. Training was very through, they definitely set you up for success. Never a full moment, lots to learn. Remote work was a huge plus. 
Great benefits but poor structure for success. If you are single then this works for you. Not for people trying to start a family. You will not have time for your family especially during busy season
Working in the ITS group, we get paid fairly well in comparison to other Tax groups. That being said, we don't have stable busy seasons, we run at 60hr per week on avg, with some weeks more and others less. NY office has a very toxic culture, they run you into the ground and you can't really trust anyone or feel support. Again, there are other teams in our office and in our group that are more balanced and do a better job taking care of their staff, but certain teams like mine are horrendous, no support from management, load you with work with unrealistic deadlines and cutting costs for real talent with replacements coming from overseas.
Best company i've ever worked for. They have major respect for their employees. Managers and  employees are all so bright and hardworking. There are no negatives.  
There was no work life balance. Always overtime. I had just stresfull life when I was an employee. But if you can handle the workload you can learn a lot of things and also good salary and benefits
Overall culture and learning opportunities are great along with flexibility to move around into different roles. However, comp is subpar to industry in the support functions.
Pros:  smart and able staff; good brand name, good client base; job security; Cons: risk/compliance; constant pressure from filling in timesheet & utilisation 
So I am a previous intern for PWC. I only decided not to go with them again because I got another offer for a higher compensation. Great company and can’t complain!
Super glad my current project is flexible, but I know that’s dependent on the project. The time in between projects feels like summer break. We also get the week of the Fourth of July off 
Strong internal infrastructure but minimal repercussions for toxic leadership including partners.  Lots of big talk about support of people but still client services first in a tough market.
Good place to start. Busy season can feel never ending, and the hours during those times are definitely taxing. I do feel like I’ve leaned a lot and am set up for my next role. 
For accounting majors, PwC is a great starting point. But, if you are more ambitious than just willing to settle in financial reporting, it becomes more difficult to move to another finance jobs.
Good job I liked it especially the benefits and the pay were pretty competitive compared compared to other companies. Plus your co-workers are extremely helpful and are like mentors

the pay was way too low compared to other jobs in the same field. the work environment/location was in a gloomy dark abandon mall which was very depressing to work in for 8hrs everyday. you also have to be a quick learner if you want to keep your job. but management/ corporate  was nice and treated the employees to ice cream parties, food trucks, raffles etc. 
It is hard to get fired once hired. You need to be willing to work a lot of hours during busy season. Pay is good but not great. Lots of benefits. Lots of senior talent and very few upper management positions. Some managers are great and the rest should not be managing people. I’m not sure why people keep voting this one of the best places to work.

If you like to be assigned tasks that you have no idea how to do and are told that you cannot ask for help.  If you enjoy being belittled during project meetings and watching a few others get treated the same.

I hope every departments are not the same. Mainly for tax, please run away quickly! Executive members treat employees like they are second rate, they're only there for the money and it shows in how they manage their teams and projects. This company operates often from pressuring you to do something without proper planning for the task. They lead you to believe that every task is 100% urgent. It is a stressful sometimes hostile work environment depending on who your manager is. Everyone is out for themselves. If you do choose to work here document everything you do, they like to spin the truth in order to make you look bad so they can look good.This is a corporate that overwork its employees, even if you continually produce it will never be enough. 
What I learned at PWC is time-management skills and building relationships with team members and clients. Time-management skill is crucial when it is in busy seasons.

Hard to generalize as there are so many different practice areas and partner personalities. What is common across all is that there is opportunity for advancement, particularly up to senior manager. Hard work and valuable contributions to work product are recognized. Partners do a good job at creating a team environment and facilitating good connections within the team both personal and professional. Important to recognize your value (comp or position) and fight for what you deserve. Easier for your cause to be championed when you're passionate about it. Make sure your career coach is the right fit and don't be afraid to request a change. Easy to burn out if you don't know how to say no to work. In any case, partners and HR actively monitor metrics to make sure this doesn't happen but the best person to do this is you. Great place to work to start or build on your career. Flexibility to move within the firm if you do well and demonstrate good work ethic.
The job is nice but the hours are long and can be stressful. You do get to learn a lot about the client and the opportunities. The benefits are also good.
Excellent envirnonment to learn and great exposure to complex problems and projects.  Terrific people and intelligent coleagues.  You work hard, play hard, and advance your career quickly.  Working there will elevate your career. 
Culture is generally good. People care but are overextended. Revenue and metrics drives work assignments without balancing impact to staff. Pace and load of work is consistently fast and high without few breaks. Plenty of opportunities for growth and advancement. Very difficult to adjust if coming from industry. If I had to do it over, I would have found a role in one of the Internal Firm Services (back office) departments... same culture and advancement opportunities without the stress and pressure of bringing in revenue and meeting utilization metrics.

It was a great experience working with PWC as an Intern and I am looking forward to get to work more in the firm and get more experience in the firm.

PwC has been up and down roller coaster. Benefits are pretty solid and pay has been consistent. During 2020, we didn't lay anybody off during covid. Management has been very open and encourage growth inside and outside of the team
PwC offers a culture that allows everyone to thrive. We support an inclusive culture by acknowledging the unique experiences and perspectives each individual brings to the table. You will also find the training, support and benefits that will help you succeed.
The one area that I think we could really improve on is in the area of our 401K matching percentage which is currently $0.25 on the dollar up to 6% of your contribution. Many of our industry clients match dollar for dollar, so quarter for dollar is a bit of a slap in the face.
A lot of favoritism especially in the Assurance - Investment Management group.  Some teams within are closely knitted and would look down upon any new resources.  makes it difficult to succeed.
Friendly employees, decent training. Overall, it's a good workplace to build your resume. Poor work life balance. Many people have to work overtime.

ProsGood PeopleConsBusy season
Being on their internal team (formerly called Internal Firm Services, now called Business Services, which encompasses all support functions including marketing, sales, IT, Alliances and administrative), I've found that the work/life balance is fabulous but the opportunity for career growth is negligible. To the contrary, the client-facing side is notoriously bad at work/life balance (hence the firm now PAYING people to take their vacation time!). But, consultants have substantially more opportunity to earn promotions. Many Businesses Services employees and consultants are extremely underpaid for what the market bears right now and as a result, the firm is hemorrhaging people. The recent reorg has left people completely confused and frustrated firmwide. All that said, it's a learning-oriented, tech-forward and highly inclusive culture. If you have a supportive team, it can be an incredible place to work. 
ProsGreat D&I initiatives, certain groups have excellent work/life balance, good vacation + holidays + unlimited sick time, great wellness benefits, outstanding flex/WFH options, highly tech-forward.ConsLackluster compensation, can be very long hours, current reorg is messy, can be hard to find new roles.
I recently got out of training for this company and it wasn’t what I excepted. During my interview process they made it seem like I wouldn’t be on the phone when I started processing but that’s not true and the training was “college style” and her words were “the training isn’t cameras on or anything”. This was a lie. I was in training with 50 people!!! 50! Like why are y’all hiring so many people??? High turn over that’s why. It was 8-5 cameras on 100% of the time. I felt like I was in virtual kindergarten. Not only that but they didn’t even send me everything I needed to start. I didn’t get my monitor until the second week of training. Then they give you homework!!! Outside of business hours!! So don’t be lied to like me, you will be on the phone, training is cameras on, and training groups are very large. 
ProsFlexible hours after trainingConsBeing treated like a child
Recognize top performers well, while if you are medium/lower bandwidth then prob sucks. Many type A persons, culture wise is not as inclusive as you’d imagine. 
- Weak leadership who is only concerned with promoting themselves to partner level- Measured by utilization on projects and paid time off time counts against it- Respect for people is very low- You are expected to be available at any hour of the day or night; so you cannot plan a life outside of work
Public accounting and busy season are tough. I was a Tax Intern in Summer 2021 and get an offer to be back for a full time role. Everyone is supportive and nice in Milwaukee office. You just need to learn and ask questions as much as you can. Long hours during Jan-April and it could be busy other months depending on your client. If you are looking for a good work life balance, public accounting is not a good choice.
ProsGood benefits, many rooms for advancement, support team, great network.ConsLong hours during busy and some other months.
Great place to start a career. Constantly being challenged. However, I hated working remotely. Additionally, the firm has gotten very political over the last few years.
In the technology group it took me 2-3 months to realize that most of leadership had no clue about technology and brought the accounting & audit mindset into a technology work environment. Projects changed 9-12 months. Whole applications that took years to build were scrapped months into go live, and there were reorgs everywhere 12 months. Overall, while you can learn a lot, the hours put in coupled with the lack of purpose or direction of the work you do will leave uou frustrated. 
ProsSmart people, good pay, learn a lotConsTerrible leadership, politics, lack of long term vision, disconnect between execution leadership and workers
If you're the type of person that's creative/intelligent but sensitive to stimuli and prefers to work at a steady pace, this environment is NOT for you. This is a hustle culture and you have to fit in if you want to perform well. Relationships often felt superficial and corporate-y, with a lack of trust.
Work on different projects Hard to maintain a work life balance due to the tight deadlines Good culture and workplace Everyone works as a team, colleagues are always happy to help each other out 
ProsIf youre on a project all expenses are coveredConsWork life balance
Work life balance sucks for consulting but that’s not necessarily specific to PwC. At PwC specifically, they are understaffed and the pay is not worth it. For barely $80k, you will be working 3 times has hard and 1.5x and long as a federal job. People in levels above frequently work until midnight and wake up the next day at like 7am to do it all again. Not the kind of work life balance I want from a job.
ProsFree phone and planConsWork life balance, pay
You don’t make good connections because they are always changing you to different market teams or engagements. The long hours will kill you. I don’t recommend to work here! 
No work life balance. Only join if you are an all rounder and super-smart. Communication skills are very important. Most supervisors are good and helpful but some may be rude. Many a times you will be shared with different teams and will be expected to work in a totally different technology, subject-matter and would be expected to adapt and still do an excellent job
ProsBenefitsConsLong Hours and Utilization
Will give an offer to almost anyone they hire because they are desperate for people and have an awfully high turn over. Most teams won't overwork you more than 50 hours a week because they want you to accept your offer. 
Prosfree intro lunch, client happy hours
Fun place to work with slow progression. Management is often slow in providing feedback, but overall a very positive experience for a recent graduate!!
ProsWell Known companyConsSlow progression
Good pay, secure job. Good colleagues, flexibility. Need to work hard but the rewards are worth it. Flexible during pandemic Ann supportive colleagues.
Great firm leadership that cares about its people. Always the first out of the big 4 to come up with ways to reward its people, like CPA bonuses, sabbaticals, vacation rewards, etc.
ProsGreat healthcare benefitsConsLong hours
It's a great place to start your career. Having PwC on the resume got my foot in the door at a lot of places. I'm constantly meeting alumni and share PTSD stories. 
The flexibility of time off is very good. Several months out of the year there isn't enough work for people to do. Very little growth opportunity. Overall not a good company.
ProsFlexibility to take time offConsNo career opportunities - low pay - poor benefits
The salary is at the bottom of the market for big accounting firms. We are also understaffed so you are doing more work for no increase in pay. There is a lot of disorganization when it comes to things like inventory counts. I got scheduled on 4 in one week before my vacation which made me have to work on my actual client workpapers while on vacation. Most of the audit new hires are frustrated and unhappy with the the compensation and workload. It is a very different experience than when I was an intern at the beginning of 2020. PwC has been getting by because of their name but they need to focus on rewarding and keeping their current employees because the staff turnover is insanely high (even for big 4 firms). They just gave a firm wide raise of 5% which still doesn't bring me up to what my friends are making at other firms with the same position and experience.
Enjoyed my time at PwC. It was a great time to learn to work with people and the technical issues of audit. Also a great time to learn to interact with clients. 
I've worked with some really smart and great people. Current CEO is really great. However, like most other Big 4, it's long hours during busy season and low pay. 
Prosculture, people, focus on technologyConspay and worklife balance
- HR will organize weekly welfare events e.g. mental wellness talk or zumba sessions, many actuvities in the firm- Depending who is yr boss, u might get a lousy or good boss. there are many projects and usually quite fast paced
Pay is way too low for the market but I wanted the job because of the experience. I worked in audit and came from a small firm and I was shocked to find people where operating in silos and blindly following test steps. I saw managers that were great at project management but had very little understanding of GAAP and how to apply technical accounting/standards. The deployment team that is responsible for scheduling billable work does not do a good job of scheduling resources so some teams are over-staffed others are under staffed. There is a lot of pressure to eat hours (regardless of what they tell you) and there are days where I had nothing to do and was expected to ask around for work. This lack of organization and stress for such low pay was unacceptable. I left and immediately enjoyed a $25k raise at my next company and have learned more and gained more experience there than I did at PwC.
ProsBenefits, diversityConsPay, culture
working for the valuation group was a great starting point to a financial career with respect to financial analysis, financial modeling, etc.  the biggest drawback was high hours relative to compensation.  felt a bit like working as an investment banker but getting paid like an accountant.
Worked at the Columbia acceleration center. Pay was extremely uncompetitive, but the work was alright. However, was project dependent. Some projects have amazing management with lots of growth opportunities and some look strictly at your production. Little input on what projects you could be on.
"Nearly a decade ago, PwC was a wonderful place to work in IT, but it slowly degraded into the worst place I ever worked.  Leadership had no clue how to delegate because goals changed all the time, and literal armies of onshore and offshore personnel (""Pwc India"") began taking jobs. Favoritism then began running rampant.  I was there for eight years and laid off during a global pandemic. PwC leadership hide behind ""doing everything for their people"" which is complete BS. It's a hard thing when smart people are asked to work stupid- when employees are expected to act like they don't understand a sinking career path when they see one, and leave or get laid off."
ProsLeavingConsToo many to list except rampant Favoritism.
Not good in taking care of there employees.Associates are not given promotion. 55 hours through out the year. Bad performance evaluation in order to hold your promotion.
Usual strategy is to stay to senior (suck up all the hours and all just survive and smile) then leave to a corp with the Big Four Name. This is the usual strategy - for partnership you have a to get a bit more political. Ask around the company about what other deparmtents there are you may find tax for example far more engaging and interesting than audit (and not to mention less politics and uncertainty and the natural lack of having to make the client like you compared to audit where the client just hates you before you even open your mouth)Consulting is where the money is and advancement imo honest opinion
ProsCareer advancement, free lunch and all of that costs your health don't buy into the hypeConsHours hours hours, low pay starting off, but again room for advancement and the name about balances this out
You can achieve work and life balance and pay is competitive. However, if you don't start from internship, it is hard to feel belong to the group. And competitive peer group. 
Proswork and life balance, competitive payConscompetition amongst peers
- A normal week (non-busy season, or client deadline) would be like 9am-5:30pm M-F in the office (Remote). Depending on your role, you have the opportunity to work from home - A busy week (busy season or client deadline) is anywhere from 60-80 hours. M-F is usually 8am-9pm (sometimes midnight) and Saturday is usually about 5-8 hours and Sunday is if you are really slammed.
ProsGood benefits, great leadership with the opportunity to learn & development your digital upskillsConsSalary could be more competitive
The only benefit of working here is having the logo on your resume. Its corporate squid game and most likely you want make it to the end. Leave before it destroys your physical and mental health.

ProsVirtual meeting, FlexibilityConsCompensations
I did not find enjoyment in the work that I did, which made each day truly hard to get through. I really liked the people on my time, but unpredictability that comes with consulting is not what I'm looking for anymore.
Prosgood teams, interesting clientsConshard work, unpredictable schedule
PwC is extremely political. Despite a warm fluffy culture, you will only get ahead if a senior sponsor takes a shine to you. Otherwise, promotions are hard to come by. Good learning and development but leadership quality varies depending on which line of service you’re working in.
ProsGreat benefits and flexibility around working environmentConsVery political, comp is way behind market rate, promotions very difficult to achieve

PricewaterhouseCoopers is a great place to work. You are given a lot of responsibility. Management is honest and ethical in its business practices. Overall no complaints.
"Like many companies, PwC is built on marketing.  Come work here! Great Pay! Great Benefits! Great training!  Advancement? NO problem.  Only, those things are only true for select groups/positions.  One benefit, money each month toward student loans, does not apply to all employees.  So, if you were in an Administrative role, you are ineligible for some of the ""peak"" benefits.  As far as people go....the company is profit driven-only. Therefore, people-especially Administrative people-are always in flux....unless, you play the games of corporate America..  You can make any company appear to be anything you want with the right marketing campaign!"
ProsTuition ReimbursementConsWork Culture
"It's a huge company so you definitely feel like a number most of the time but my department has extremely intelligent and nice people. Working with partners on things can be up or down depending on their personality/devotion to a project. Overall the mission of the company is great but I think it sometimes doesn't trickle all the way down to the ""working"" folks level."
ProsBig company, potential mobilityConsWork/life balance
Been with firm 8 years. High turn over for public accounting industry. Experience really depends on engagement team you get staffed on. Possible internal move but don’t happen easily. Overall good platform.
Ok for fresh undergrads but not for long term. Teams and people can be clique. Hard to meet billable hours and can face job insecurity when businesses are slow.
You will be paid less than the market and probably less than the other Big 4. If you want to progress you will need to put a stupid amount of hours. Flexibility is fine.
ProsWorking from homeConsPoor Management, Low Payment
Management & evaluation of personnel does not work. Employee exploit. After working countless busy seasons they decided that I was not fit for the job. Doing my part but management just didn't care. At the end of the day, the paper hold everything that is thrown in it.
I think it's a good company but your impression must depend on each project you are assigned to. Sometimes you need to work extra to meet the expectation. Global network was very nice. 
Most people I've met have been pretty great, but overall the work is endless for really poor compensation. Most people I know have left for greener pastures in terms of compensation and work life balance. 
PwC is reputed to be a more friendly, sociable firm than the other Big Four firms, with more social and sports events than the others. It is seen as 'a firm that takes care of its employees'. It is often noted that the salary can be lower at PwC.Many companies out there are doing some great things for their employees — so how does such a large employer like PwC stay competitive and continue its presence on Fortune's list? (This year, the firm earned the #23 spot on the list -- the highest ranking they've received yet!)

I would like to be employed at an amazing company as PwC. I  encourage my kids to study in the direction in order for them to be employed at PwC. Working as a Frontline Receptionist at the time, my most enjoyable moment is assisting each and every staff member with my excellent service the moment they arrived at work. Even so that that one of the Supervisors contact me just to tell me they really miss my smile at reception. It is such a good feeling to know people appreciate your efforts in going the extra-mile especially when it comes to double bookings of boardrooms, but you still find a way to accommodate them.

Learned a lot and grew a lot but the company definitely needs to work on providing a good work life balance. A great job to work at to learn and grow exponentially but not for everyone
Company preaches work-life balance, but its non-existent. Be ready to take your laptop everywhere you go on the weekends in case a client email comes in. On top of working over 100 hrs/week to meet client demands, you're expected to contribute to PwC's internal/firm 'reinvest' activities, which in itself make up another 40 hrs/week -  a.k.a. build a new toolkit for synergy tracking, or some other 'digital' flavor-of-the-month initiative.  
It’s public accounting, not much else to say. Crazy hours, crazy deadlines, pushy clients, pushy managers, office politics are absolutely ridiculous (I was told I didn’t get promoted because I “worked for the wrong director” even though my snapshots were fully filled out).
ProsBrand name recognition on resumes, pace of learningConsWork life balance, low pay, very structured, office politics are inane
The nature of consulting allows you to learn A LOT quickly, and PwC does a great job of fostering on the job development. Even before the pandemic, there was a lot of flexibility to work from home when you weren’t traveling. Hoping that flexibility continues as restrictions are lifted.
ProsCulture, flexibilityConsWork/life balance
You graduate and work until you can't. You do learn a lot in the process but it takes a lot to keep the rhythm, basically if you have no life you'll be ok otherwise prepare to never see your significant other, family, friends etc.

you learn a ton but the job tends to be too much over time. The hours are rough and you get super stretched thin. The pay and advancement is solidly consistent.
PwC is a great place to kickstart your accounting career. Promotion is almost guarenteed after several years and there is always an opportunity to grow within the firm.
I started working here at a pivotal time in my life.  The Firm has helped me grow in so many ways. People are amazing, lots of opportunities if you go out and get them.  The work is challenging and I have made lifelong friends.
ProsYou can wear as many hats as you want and do different things - that is rewarded.ConsSometimes repetitive initiatives and false deadlines.
Always had incentives, tried to keep everyone during COVID. Will work with you until there is no other way to keep you placed with one of the departments. They give incentives for vacation, being healthy or working towards it. Their work life balance is almost perfect. You dont earn sick pay, they ask you to stay away if you are contagious. If less than 2 days, your paid, 3 - 4 needs a doctor excuse, and 5 or more automatically short-term disability. They have quite a bit of software to learn, and its worth it. I loved working here.
ProsAlways incentives and can be funConslower management under too much pressure.
I generally find PwC a good place to work in the professional services space. They offer many opportunities for learning (both in-house and through continuing ed), generous parental leave policies and good opportunities for advancement. During the pandemic they were particularly good about not laying off people (opting for salary freezes instead). PwC also has a very liberal work from home policy (even before the pandemic).

"Early on I enjoyed my time with PwC, the rose tinted glasses wear off eventually however and the reality is that the culture will work you to the bone. Weekends and evenings are a consistent expectation. Lots of the sayings which are parroted are not often followed. ""We're not performing brain-surgery.""""No one dies if we don't complete an audit"" You're going to work that weekend to get the workpaper onto the manager's desk by Monday. Believe you me buddeh. The fact of the matter is, stressed out people stress out other people. Perhaps its an inevitability. There is constant name changes for simple programs which makes it difficult to keep up with the language of the company. There is a substantial amount of bloat software which wears down the computers and clogs the system. Even though the company is supposed to be ""tech-enabled"" it's more of an afterthought. Most of the tools employed are unnecessary to an audit, but rather an lukewarm attempt to stay modern. The expectations shift from team to team, consistency is not an valued concept with PwC. The type of work and the quality of the audit can shift constantly.Overall, I wouldn't go back unless it was a life or death situation. I valued my time with this company but feel my work effort and participation was both spurned and ignored. "

Peers are encouraged to not engage in conversation with Partners/Directors/Senior Managers/ Managers/ etc. The lower threshold are groomed into keeping their distance from upper management and keeping conversations at a minimum. They carry a great deal of separation from the lower end of the spectrum to the top of professionals. You are in a sense made to feel like a servant of some sort. The culture is almost barbaric in that sense. No efforts are made to make the lower workers feel welcomed or appreciated.

I’ve been at PwC for almost two years now, straight out of college. So far it’s been a great experience. The firm has made very positive moves during our 15 months of working from home so far. I will say that it is hard to maintain work life balance. It’s hard to do disconnect when everyone on your team works extremely long hours. In addition, comp isn’t that great.

Basically everything you hear about public accounting, the good and the horrible, I found to be completely true at PwC. Low pay, but you get “paid in experience” that will make getting a job outside of PwC pretty easy. The culture is dependent on your specific engagement team. My experience, unfortunately, was overbearing management, horrible work-life balance (I make it work as an associate, but seniors and managers consistently work nights and weekends), at times a toxic environment, and extremely high turnover. I’ve learned way more than I would have at a non-public accounting job, so it is a good place to start your career, but I absolutely will not be staying long-term.

Working at PwC is very demanding but provides a great opportunity to work with high performing individuals in a supportive and positive environment.  The company's culture places a lot of emphasis on the well being of our employees and supports a flexible work/life balance.  All in all, a good place to work if you are willing to work hard, put in the hours and work with high quality team in the finance/accounting space.
While both the company and the people at PwC are great, work/life balance is lacking to a large degree. You will learn a lot and can quickly grow but you will need to be prepared to work a lot.
ProsCulture, peopleConsWorklife balance, benefits
Countless opportunities for professional development in terms of technical knowledge and global network of qualified people. The size of the transactions I've seen are massive (in the billions), and you get to learn a lot about the ins and outs of a multinational company in your professional area.The starting pay for entry level will depend largely on the education level (JD/LLM vs. accounting degree), but we see it level off over time, which can mean very competitive pay.I wouldn't expect work-life balance when it comes to working hours, but my team has been very flexible with working remotely.Caveat: I have heard that experience will depend on your geographic location,  team, and client/engagement. I consider myself lucky for meeting my team and being on the client accounts that I am on. But the vast majority of PwC professionals that I've worked with internally (other locations (including foreign) and different line of service) have been very easy to work with.
ProsCompetitive pay, nice fringe benefits, autonomy (as long as you prove yourself)ConsA lot of self-help and teaching in the beginning with no one actively training you (technical, soft skills, and/or admin)
A lot of good opportunities especially when first starting out. The overall structures in place to help you succeed are proven but you do have to put forth the right effort in order to succeed, as it should be.

You work with a lot of smart people at PwC and get a lot of great exposure but, as with any consulting job, the work life balance is not great nor is the compensation (relative to what you could receive by jumping to a competing firm or exiting to industry). Overall, it's a good place to spend a few years and get the name on your resume / good experience in a lot of areas, but don't think it's great for long-term prospects.
in Kazakhstan, working in PwC is very prestigious, the salaries are considered good compared to the market, corporate culture is very professional, people are talented and have a high team spirit. However, the work there requires too much of personal time i.e. overtimes on weekdays and working on weekends/holidays is a norm in Kazakhstani offices. This was the main reason of my problems with health. I worked in PwC Kazakhstan for 5 years and really loved my work and people there, but after working in the industry I realized how much efforts and personal time the work in PwC took from me. Anyway I am thankful for such valuable professional experience as it really gave me strong professional development and knowledge which I use today. This is definitely a good work place for fresh graduates to start with who are ready to dedicate most of their time to work. 
Prosfree late dinners and late taxis, can use medical leaves any time a day if really sick. People are smart, corporate culture is good, team spirit is highConsovertime work, often work on weekend or during holidays. Deadlines are strict, some clients may be very stressful to work with
Lack of leadership and necessary training. Not many opportunities to advance due to the lack of training and effort by management to apply feedback from staff about areas that may need improvement 
ProsBenefitsConsManagement and leadership as a whole
Your team is there to support you and push you to advance. Everyone is very friendly and positive. Always working on new things and feeling challenged. 
If you are liked, then you will do fine. If you have an opinion or ruffle feathers, then you won’t do well. Bizarre performance management techniques. You have to dress up here so find a good dry cleaner. One bump in the road and you are out. 
ProsNice merchConsCulture
Working with PwC is great except for the work-life balance during busy season. Busy seasons can range anywhere from 2-6 months for people, and mine have been about 5 months on average every year I've been with the firm. While I love the teams and clients I get to work with and the fast-paced nature of the job, the work-life balance during the five months of busy season can be extremely exhausting. PwC is a great place to start a career because the learning is invaluable, but it is definitely not for the faint of heart. 
ConsWork-life balance
Expect long hours and high stress. So much of your experience will depend on your clients and team. Auditing large public companies will give you the opportunity to learn quickly but burn out fast. Great to start your career. 
ProsOpportunities to work on interesting projectsConsLong hours, high stress
Love the people and the culture. You truly learn alot at PwC and you will work with some of the brightest in the business. Its what keeps you at pwc. 
ProsThe cultureConsLong hours
No work life balance. Only join if you are an all rounder and super-smart. Communication skills are very important. Most supervisors are good and helpful but some may be rude. Many a times you will be shared with different teams and will be expected to work in a totally different technology, subject-matter and would be expected to adapt and still do an excellent job
ProsBenefitsConsLong Hours and Utilization
stressful work environment, hard to have work life balance, has very good flexibility though and easy to make friends who are the same or similar age as you
My internship was virtual so my experience is probably different. Everyone I met was so kind and wanted to make sure I never felt lost or alone. Assignments given to me were fairly easy, but sometimes they were so busy that they would be giving me assignments until late hours. The latest I had to work was 10 pm and I got paid overtime. 
ProsNice coworkers, good experience, build relationship w clientsConsLong hours, stressful environment
Great projects and intersting work. However long hours, stressful client-boss interactions start to take a toll. Combine project work with internal development, it gets busy
ProsGreat payConsNo WLB
I am essentially on-call 18 hours a day. There are no clear instructions and the workflow is extremely inconsistent.  I do not feel like I am part of a team and expressing concerns has proven to be pointless.  
ProsCompensationConsPeople, hours.
Many employees have left the company. Instead off hiring more people, they are giving the people there a lot more work with no pay increase. They are actually doubling my hours to 80 hours a week.
If you don’t bring in 50+ billable hours per week, in addition to endless bureaucratic paperwork, online courses, travel and internal meetings, you won’t survive.  It is all about the bottom line, regardless who much they talk about inclusion, careers and work life balance.  What you did last year, makes no difference when partners want a bigger bonus in their own pockets.  They have a very sharp, bottom line driven culture, where you are just a peg in the wheel that makes partners money.  Don’t fool yourself, spend 1-2 years there max, and move on to a real company instead.
ProsCompensationConsNobody cares and it’s all about the bottom line.
Super stressful but the exit opportunities are great. You will learn a lot of soft skills and be exposed to top management. Overall if it wasn’t for the hours I would stay for a long time. 
Worked there as an intern. I was not really busy due to virtual internship, but I have leant lots of new things. Being a global mobility service intern was nice but I really wanted to do something else to see what kind of tax I like the best
ProsLots of different kinds of giftsConslack of communication at times
I’ve worked here for 3 years and so far no major complaints other than WLB - if you want to be a high performer, you will need to put extra hours. They have a metric that shows your overtime hrs lol.
ProsCultureConsWlb
Ability to do meaningful work and work with very talented employees, management and executives. My opinion and data analytics were appreciated when making data driven decision making.
Prosexcellent travel support in major citiesConsVery competitive work environment and culture
Great culture, encourages diversity. Challenging and fun. On tech constantly trying to leverage the best technologies and a lot of smart people. You get to learn Client Services from the best. 
ProsProfessionalism, Learning cultureConsIf in tech, doesn't pay as other in bay area.
great place to grow your career, dynamic fast paced environment. Firm likes to change a lot. sometimes unrealistic deadlines. Lots of politics. good people
Good for advancement if you don’t mind tons of overtime and a lot of turnover. I got to be apart of many projects which was great, but they would not higher more people. You end up picking up more of the slack.
ProsYounger staff, lots of room to work on different clients.ConsVery long hours, management isn’t the best
I enjoy working at PwC. They are always adapting to changes and are very supportive. Management is always there for you and I am always learning new things. 
ProsRemote workConsLimited growth opportunity
Benefits are broad and culture is great, but pace of change is often unsustainable and really hard to find balance with work and life, despite it being encouraged. Decisions take way too much vetting and process. Very risk averse. Sometimes leaders want to be in too much if the details
ProsGreat benefitsConsToo much process
I've been at PwC for almost 9 years, beginning at Sr Associate. At the top leadership level, the firm has done a really great job at showing it cares for its people - D&I initiatives, learning and development commitments, etc... Your experience at the firm will mostly be tied to your individual group and mostly the groups culture. If your career goal is program management, PwC does a really great job giving you the tools needed to succeed. If it's something else, I think the firm has a long ways to go to catch up to the industry. The firm also has ample red tape, limiting and drastically slowing down how we do business
ProsWork life balance (to an extent), access to learning opportunitiesConsHealthcare benefits are pretty terrible, substantial red tape
At PwC, once you find your tribe (i.e., teammates that trust and respect you), you will feel very supported and included. Without this, the company is very large and it's difficult to find a sense of purpose.
Great experience to self manage my time and supportive environment for success.  Opportunity to work with talented professionals and develop new skills.
Good benefits They work together 2 week payIf I don’t understand they teach meLoveCareLifestyle We work every week No call no show they keep warning 
PwC is a great place to start your career but be prepared to put in some long hours and essentially have no work/life balance. Other than that it is great opportunity to grow as a professional, learn a lot and work with smart, young motivated individuals. 
No work life balance. Only join if you are an all rounder and super-smart. Communication skills are very important. Most supervisors are good and helpful but some may be rude. Many a times you will be shared with different teams and will be expected to work in a totally different technology, subject-matter and would be expected to adapt and still do an excellent job
ProsBenefitsConsLong Hours and Utilization
 Great place to work with great people! Variety of opportunities for development, training, and professional advancement. Surrounded by supportive and intelligent co-workers.
The only good thing about PwC is that it looks good on your resume and you will like your team (Hopefully) but that is the luck of the draw. Overall the company does not care about you as an individual and you are a cog in a machine to them and extremely replaceable. 
ProsResume BuilderConsEverything Else
Great place to start your career out of college. You will be challenged every day, but you will also learn a lot along the way. Lots of young and smart people to work with. 
Prossmart people, fast paced, quick progression up the ladderConsno work life balance, multiple competing priorities all year long
Unclear expectations and deadlines. Everything was a fire drill. Don't expect to be supported in your role. Work-life balance is non-existent. There's room for promotional opportunities if you can survive in this environment long enough.
Very nice place to work and grow a career. You need to network and know people by working on various projects. It is a place that exposes you to very important aspects of auditing
ProsGreta benefits
Great place to work, but you definitely have to know the right people to get ahead. The work you’ll be exposed to will definitely challenge you and you will grow, but without knowing the right people you will stay at the same level. 
ConsWeekly fires with unrealistic deadlines
Lots of office politics can control everything. They can tell you to leave at anytime with no feedback. team not kind. the pay was good the job was fairly easy 
Prosfree lunchConsnot inclusive
Worked as an intern here and I loved the people and found the work pretty challenging. It was great working with smart people who were willing to teach and help
ProsSmart peopleConsHours are long
Too much work, way understaffed. Sometimes lack of training to associates from upper mgmt. Tone from top does not care about you. Burn and churn factory.
Worst place to work at, micromanagers breathing down your neck, pay is extremely low, if you are a college graduate then go for it but other than that expect to not have a life outside work 
PwC is sleeping on its past brand power. Ideals and vision are world-class, but groupthink, us vs. them, and friendship nepotism make it hard for newcomers to become part of a clique. There are a handful of exemptions to this rule. It is a machine where YOUR numbers are the only thing that matters.Vast opportunities for learning and exposure to amazing clients. 
ProsVast opportunities for learning and exposure to amazing clientsConsClique culture - only your numbers count
They work you to death and make you feel stressed. It was better in the office but the work from home atmosphere is terrible. Can't get to know any of your coworkers and just work your butt off. This job is not for me. 
ProsGrowth, coworkersConshours, pay, stress levels, expectations
getting onto good projects is all about who you know, and if the work you want to do isn’t selling, then you might feel as though your development is stalling. the business is 100% focused on the client and sometimes that takes away from focus on your career personally. overall wonderful place to build your career and grow as a well rounded, agile employee. 
Proslearning, good ceo, leader in employee developmentConsdevelopment in areas of interest, pay
There is interesting work and people seem to care about us being happy and growing. You do need to be careful occasionally with politics. Work-life balance isn't terrible - people are understanding. But like any big 4 company, the hours are not the best.
ProsGood benefits (free phone, payment on student loans, etc)Consbureaucracy and long hours
A great company to work for to surround yourself with smart, motivated peers and learn new things through exposure to different clients and project types.
Great place to start of your career in consulting with the big emphasis on learning. Company is still trying to balance being a general professional services firm while trying to compete with big consulting firms (i.e., stay PwC while focusing on consulting-specific improvements) 
Generally, PwC was a pretty good place to work - I liked the other people and organizations I came into contact with, and the company tried to have engaging activities.
ProsFlexibility and little to no micromanagementConsWhen people leave, the company seldom hires a replacement, all responsibilities are just kept on being added on top of the remaining employees, eventually you are putting multiple additional hours and the salary does not adjust for that.
You work in a competitive team environment. Its fun and challenging to meet the goals.Exceptional detail skills required and you utilize your knowledge. They are always innovating and taking ideas to improve. Growth opportunities are there if you want them. 
ProsFood goid food during busy seasonConsNone
I learned so much working at PWC and am grateful for the experience. It is a fast paced and at times stressful environment with demanding hours. Lots of opportunity to advance. 
ProsPeopleConsStressful
I've worked at PwC for almost 5 years in the assurance practice in Philly - great entry-level job to learn about auditing and accounting and great client exposure. I've enjoyed the people I've worked with and the learning opportunities. The busy seasons are rough in terms of stress and hours, but this is the best place to start a career.
ProsGreat colleagues, learning opportunities, upward mobilityConsStress, work hours, pay is mediocre
No work life balance. Only join if you are an all rounder and super-smart. Communication skills are very important. Most supervisors are good and helpful but some may be rude. Many a times you will be shared with different teams and will be expected to work in a totally different technology, subject-matter and would be expected to adapt and still do an excellent job
ProsBenefitsConsLong Hours and Utilization
I can't quite put my finger on what I didn't like about PwC, but I think it boils down to the leadership...at least in the organization I was in (Data & Analytics). The majority of leadership were part of an acquisition, and they maintained a clique.  Further, they weren't as smart as they thought they were w.r.t. data.Generally, PwC was a pretty good place to work - I liked the other people and orgs I came into contact with, and the company tried to have engaging activities. But in my group, I found they catered to the clients in a reckless and unfruitful way. And b/c I didn't particularly respect my leadership, they, in turn, didn't really respect me. I certainly never got any coaching or guidance...or even a boost to help me get a working relationship established with key selling leads.
ProsGreat brand. Pretty good working culture.ConsI found it ridiculously stressful to work there.
Good place to work with professional ethics. Work from home is good but sometimes yo miss the collaboration in the office. Travel can sometimes be non-stop.
Pros401K, HSA and Retirement planning
Working for PwC is really interesting as consultants get to work on projects across different industries. However, work life balance is not respected at all. We always work on weekends and for very long hours (4:00am). 
Prosgood benefitsConsno work life balance
It was a great platform to learn Global business, taxes and the corporate world after graduating college, that experience allowed me to move to ahead on my career.
ProslearningConsPay
Impossible to have a family life and work at the Big 4Stress and demands of public accounting are unsustainableDo your time and get out as quick as you can
ProsLots of learningConsHours, No life outside of work
People are nice and helpful, you get to work closely with upper management however compensation is less compared to industry standards, can improve on that
Your experience at PwC will depend on your teams and Partners. In advisory (particularly consumer finance) there are superficial relationships and workplace politics.
PwC cares about developing staff and has great official values, especially the D&I focus. They might do more to live the values - there are still very few women in leadership. Constant pivoting of priorities, but the people are truly wonderful throughout the entire org as is the culture. 
ProsFocus on developing and progressing you, embrace of new technologyConsWork-life balance is nonexistent, you WILL burn out
I was lucky enough to be placed on a good team with supportive teammates and helpful managers. Not all teams are like this. Corporate tries to take car of employees with a lot of benefits and nice/new facilities. 
ProsCoworkersConslong hours during busy season
Fun place, salary intermediate, training opportunities relatively fewer than competition, poor management, does not do what it preaches, cannot keep rare talents, harbor dead conspiratorial dead woods.
ProsFun placeConsPoor management
The firm pays well and provides a lot of training. There are many opportunities to earn recognition and bonuses. The leadership at the top can do no wrong though even when there are obvious toxins squatting in those roles. Upward mobility is a popularity contest. 
ProsPay, time offConstoxic leaders
It’s a great place to learn and people are nice and supportive but also workaholics and after 5+ years the hours and the stress really start to get to you.
PwC is a great place to start your career. However, the late nights and long hours get old very fast especially on engagements you are not interested in. Generally a younger group of people and very understanding of flexibility and working from home during off seasons.
They have established every industry, private and public, and have experts in everything.  So when developing business, you can always say that you have experts in what the potential client is doing.  But they charge top rate and the clients know this and don't want to pay it at the development level.  Also there is not a support staff to help make presentations, research, etc. and it's a 7-day job to do it yourself when you're not at work beating the bushes and developing.  The people above you are doing the same thing and cherrypick the work for rate and hours and don't send it down.
ProsReputation and learningConsNot supportive
Depending on the Line of Service, client facing vs. internal, you will have different experiences here. The strongest element is the overall culture and how they up-skill all of their employees. 
ProsRoom for growth, culture and employee focusedConsBurn out, work/life balance, management bias
Terrible. You're essentially working minimum wage after getting a master's degree and CPA. Granted I don't think PwC as a whole is this bad however the Boston office is. It's the largest accounting firm in Boston by far but it's also the absolute worst. Go literally anywhere else. 
ProsFree food and drinksConsMost conniving and disrespectful people you will ever meet
Really you have to understand what the industry is trying to accomplishing and what is expected of employees based on that. You have to be prepared to take the CPA exam, otherwise continued employment and skill improvement is severely hindered.
Good place to start out. Long hours. Tracking your time. Good connections to industry for when you want to jump ship and work for one of your clients. Good training 
During COVID-19, all work from home, which is a better work-life balance than having to commute to the office. Overall, the company isn't terrible to work for, has decent pay and benefits, but there is no sense of purpose for the work I am doing and some experienced associates will try to overwork you as a new associate. I feel like I have learned little to nothing in this position and am ready to leave the moment I get my CPA.
ProsWork from home, good benefits
Overall PwC is a good place to work. People are very nice and support each other. The job is challenging and interesting, while helping clients, I fell I made impacts.
ProsAnnual leave, sick leave and holidaysConsNo work life balance
No work life balance. Only join if you are an all rounder and super-smart. Communication skills are very important. Most supervisors are good and helpful but some may be rude.

Toxic culture, incompetent / checked out management, woefully inadequate training - disorganized and confusing systems - one way communication - Misery Inc.  
ProsWork from homeConsToo many to fit in this box
For an accounting firm, I was surprised by how nice and down to earth people are here. It made leaving so hard! There are also many resources like work papers, IT support, people are very smart here as well. 
overworked and underappreciated, lots of long hours during busy season. People can be very difficult to work with but outside of busy season there is great flexibility and plenty of vacation if you have the time to take it
Don't go into public accounting.  The work is boring and unfulfilling.  The hours are brutal and no one cares about you.  It's been 7 years and I don't ever miss it.
The internship was well organized, allowing me to work with different groups I was interested in. We were always encouraged to ask questions and learn more about what different teams did. It being summer, my workload was really quite relaxed and I was able to take time to learn different software. PwC did a great job pairing interns with buddies and managers, so we felt we always had someone to talk with. Everyone was always willing to help.
Prosintern events throughout the summer, intern class becomes quite closeConsnot the most stimulating work, few days when there was nothing for me to do because team was rushing to meet deadlines
Good Company to gain experience. Constant changes in the work environment.  Always under pressure to meet the deadlines. Client always comes first and then employees.
if you work with good team, you can stick around for many years. but if you work with bad team, you probably want to get out ASAP.Deployment can be very political. if you are the favored child, you will have higher chance of getting on better projects
Excellent company.  Benefits are top notch and management wants to help employees grow and succeed.  Positive culture and excellent work life balance.  
ProsBenefits, Time Off, Worklife Balance
You will learn a lot from this company but no work-life balance, have great training to employee and very good workplace culture, the experience is valuable.
The people here truly care about you. The training is extensive to allow for mobility within the company in various roles. The ability to work from home is great for flexibility and they provide the necessary resources to get work done from anywhere. Great culture. 
ProsBenefits, trainingConsVery large company, a lot to learn
PwC provides little training and little support for women.  The management  is awful and many talented people leave.  The only enjoyable part of the work is the independence provided.

ProsMany career option once you arise to managerConsLong hour of work
Not sure I’d recommend working within the comms function.  Lots of turnover, leaders are cliquey and difficult and they’ve put Tax professionals in charge of communications.  monotonous and Not very rewarding. 
I can't say anything negative about my experience working at PwC. The environment is up to date, the free coffee selection is great. The cafeteria serves Sushi..what else can you ask for? They provide massage chairs in the break room, that are open for all to use as well.
ProsEverythingConsNothing
Great place to grow a career, but easy to fall prey to politics or get lost in the shuffle of a place so large.  They care about their people and ensure our safety and security - always.  Great benefits
ProsGreat benefits and flexibilityConsPolitics and hierarchy can be difficult to navigate
The project structure makes it difficult to take ownership over your career advancement. PwC core staff are usually very focused on meeting a deliverable therefore  coaching or mentoring are unheard of. It feels very much luck based on times, some core staff and projects were exceptional while others were  mean-spirited. Unfortunately moving projects is frowned upon. You feel very disposable since you are rolled off if you don't hit target or reminded that unless you are in QC role you are not contributing making it impossible to receive constructive feedback. High turnover and it management knows this so there is a sense of put up and shut up. Very diverse and inclusive environment but there is definite favouritism that becomes disheartening. Perfect opportunity for fresh grads trying to get into the job market but unsure of what to specialize in and want an appetizer into working for a big four consulting firm or unable to get into core. Though the ability to transfer into core is difficult i.e. after two years and subject to an endorsement and availability.

More often than not, we walk out of there with a smile on our face and have had better experiences more so than bad ones, and while those bad ones shouldn’t be overlooked in any sort of capacity, they won’t make us stop loving our favorite department store.
Working in Big 4 is not sunshine and rainbows. PwC is a very fast paced environment which means you learn a lot but expectations to work 50+ hours a week in non-busy season are still prevalent. Tax has 2 busy seasons out of the year (April 15 and October15/November 15). The latter busy season you are working 80-110 hours per week for 2-3 months straight.

Long hours, under compensated but have the ability to work with very intelligent young people. Lots of opportunity to grow and have exposure to many different facets of accounting 
I must it is a good place to upon, only one should be always free to accept automation tool. Few more things to work upon then it will be great place to work.
Good learning experiences with the firm and opportunities to work with talented people who are willing to invest the time to help you succeed. However, the firm is overly focused on utilization and meeting budgeting goals. Busy year round with long work hours.

I learned a lot about consulting and it was a great experience. As an intern, they had kept me really motivated and challende throughout the internship. It is a good company to gain expderience.
Top notch organization that invests heavily in the development of their employees.I was also extremely impressed with PwC's commitment to being an industry leader in technological innovation and development. The software applications used to execute our work were internally developed and top of the line.   
Great entry level position and lots of opportunities for advancement - strong leadership and a commitment to diversity - time off was amazing and frequent added days off. 
ProsWork/lifeConsNone
I worked as a Technical Data Analyst interns at the company, my time at the company was great, I got to learn a lot things and it had a appropriate system in place with mentors and managers to help interns. 
Busy seasons have become longer since COVID-19. People are generally helpful and fun. Work-life balance has decreased in the past year and it looks like it is the new normal for public accounting.
PwC offered incentive pay so compensation was good. Personnel from Manager to Senior were solid people. Unfortunately, higher management were arrogant, rude and untrustworthy. PwC will misrepresent a project’s length and your job security. PwC poorly treats contractors.
ProsExperience is good for your resume. Some good people.ConsFailure of communications from upper management that could be deemed misrepresentations.
Management does not care about growth.  You need to agree to be a pawn in order to be promoted.  Your career nor your life is not your own.  If you don’t oblige to being a human puppet, they will get rid of you.

ProsGreat work environment for those willing to be challengedConsTravel was a requirement for my position
great work culture but longer hours than most. you would need to have strong discipline to find out. Flip side is PwC is a big, multinational. You'll get better gigs there, but won't make as much, and have more competition as you up-rung the ladder towards promotional opportunities.

ProsGood cultureConsLong hours
I have learnt a lot. great place to work. Strong leadership and training. allows for you to grow individually and as a team member. Many resources at your disposal. Great people.
PwC is a good place to start your career and you will learn a lot working here. Experiences can vary greatly depending on which teams and clients you work with. It is a very high pressure environment and burn out is common. I personally don’t consider it sustainable to work here long term, especially given compensation and perks are not great compared to industry standards.
Good place to start a career; lots of opportunity for development, variety of work, etc. Culture largely depends on your specific line of service, office, and team. Pay starts relatively low for associates but ramps quickly once promoted in 2-3 years. 
The hours someone will work at this company are unhealthy, regardless of what the recruiting literature says. You will be paid less than the average salary for position unless you devote your life to the company and become a partner. So much effort and money goes into the public relations here but, in the end you are put behind a computer to work 50-100 hour weeks.
ProsEmploymentConsCulture, pay, hours
They lie about a lot of benefits that they offer, flexible most of the time, and generally just wouldn’t recommend working for the service delivery center.
Even if you work as a contractor, it is the best job I’ve ever had in the US. Workload is reasonable, compensation is competitive and an opportunity to work fully remotely is definitely a huge pros.
ProsRemote workConsContract is only 2 years
The environment is great for the right person. If you want to be in professional advisory services, it is a tough world but PwC can do a lot better to reconcile the firm's messaging with the reality. There used to be better work life balance but that now only applies if you're in a good group. If not, you will work your tail off with little relief and the firm's messaging almost seems to make it worse. The idea was that the compensation was not as high as other firms because of the WLB incentives but those have close to vanished and now it is a mill of working under more pressure without the increased compensation. I'd say great place to start but if you don't fit in don't force it, go find something else. It is not a firm for everyone especially diverse individuals. The messaging works for those who are in the majority but falls on deaf ears for those who want to believe it truly has a diverse and inclusive approach. It does not and cannot figure out how to do so. So, if you are super corporate and want to work in a large organization that has had much of its personal touch sapped out of it then this is a great environment to gain fantastic experience and to network but do not drink the kool aid. 
Prosgood for resume, excellent for learningConsNo work life balance, compensation not competitive, High deductible medical benefits

PwC has been treating their employee fairly with good compensation and equal opportunity. The culture is more relax but definitely still some overtime. There is a strong sense of digitalization with the company
PwC is a wonderful place to start your career, young and energized. The more busy seasons you work, the more stressed and burnt out you become. The unfortunate part is that some people have fantastic experiences and work-life balance while others are unlucky and are stuck in a place where it feels like busy season all year round. In the end, if you can put in the work and time early on, do it. Get the experience and leave. 
"ProsFree phone, ""unlimited"" sick days, flexible scheduleConsWork-life balance does not exist, you're just another number"
Hiring in 2020 has been a nightmare for many companies. Going into a pending summer intern experience with PWC, they decided to cancel the in-person experience in exchange for an entirely virtual learning and digital upskilling experience for all interns while simultaneously offering job offers to all interns. This says a lot about the firm, investing in the candidates they had already vetted and brought in during a time of so much uncertainty. 
I was a staff accountant at PWC. It was a great job which I enjoyed. Great  staff and management who were always supportive. The work enviromnent was superb and the was continual room for personal growth and development.
ProsGreat work environment; room for growth;ConsPromotion is based on passing exams
This was my first job out of MBA. It was challenging and there was some bad managers. Once you find your crew inside the firm its a lot of fun. I still in touch with the folks I worked with. Great place to jump start your career.
Internal firm resources for learning and development are second to none. Experts are a phone call away. It's a ton of work, but intellectually stimulating.
ProsProfessional developmentConsYou'll work your tail off
Learned a lot, helpful managers. Work life balance can be tough with travel, but mostly it depends on your client and the team. The company as a whole is great.
Speaking for PwC advisory only. Great culture at the company, and a lot of opportunities to network with others from different groups and cultivate mentorships. As a POC, I felt supported and empowered.
Overall good place to start a career as you enter the workforce. You get a lot of exposure in a very short amount of time. You also get to work with a lot of very intelligent individuals.
The overall culture at PwC is awesome.  Great flexibility and the integrity and overall brand at the firm made my job easier as a Recruiter.  The firm met my standards for ethics.
I joined PwC after graduating from college and worked there for 5 years. I feel I was really lucky to work in a professional firm with tons of talent people and clear prompting mechnism. 
No work life balance. Only join if you are an all rounder and super-smart. Communication skills are very important. Most supervisors are good and helpful but some may be rude. Many a times you will be shared with different teams and will be expected to work in a totally different technology, subject-matter and would be expected to adapt and still do an excellent job
ProsBenefitsConsLong Hours and Utilization
Not disappointed with the overall job, like every job there are hiccups here and there. However, it's not a place to build a career because it takes forever to reach the top. It's a stepping stone job to another job with greater pay. 
ProsCoworker, Flexible schedule, VacationConsHealth Insurance, Tons of training on top of audit work
Work life balance is tough but not impossible. It is a fast paced and stressful environment. A lot of hours will be required to be put in during busy season.
Work/life balance can be a challenge, but they generally reward hard work and good performance with bonuses and raises which are respectable for the industry.  Always opportunity to take more challenging work.
no layoffs during covid19; great people; relaxed when not busy season; very busy busy season. hardest part is pay being low for an associate during busy times.
Great place to start a career, but hard to justify staying after a couple years due to low compensation and opportunities elsewhere. Most will work here for a couple years for the breadth of experience provided and make senior or manager promotion, then leave for greener pastures.
If you don't want to have a life and constantly be under stress, this is the job for you. No matter how you say no, management does not understand. It's not physically or mentally possible to assign this much work and have it all done. 
ProsIt's accounting, don't know if there's any prosConsNo work/life balance
Work at this company is okay, depends on where you work exactly (eg. city). I personally assess work at this company as something that may suit some workers.
● Work-life balanceWould like weekend hours to be available instead of the standard Monday - Friday.● Pay & benefitsMBO Partners take out 16% which too much. The cost of “payroll” should be shifted to Pwc not contractor.● Job security and advancementThis is contract work. You don’t know when your time will be up. There is no job security.● ManagementManagement is unorganized. I am very surprised about how unorganized this place is.● CultureIt’s a do your work and keep your head down culture. No one is friendly. It’s all about production.● OverallThis would have been a five star review. I deducted a star for being unorganized, bad management, inadequate training, and lack of communication. I’m a Compliance Analyst contractor. The work is not bad. However, there should be some changes in management. The procedures for the work have errors in them, which makes the job difficult. Pages are not numbered correctly. They expect you to read procedures that don’t make sense. They do not have adequate trainers. They have people that do the job you do and dictate orders. Pwc should invest in the quality of trainers and training. Training was not useful at all when I first started. There is no open door communication. This company is very unorganized. The work itself is not the problem—the people are the problem. I know the higher ups do not care, but I thought I’d share my experience. I won’t let people’s attitudes get to me in this organization. I have compassion and under everybody have personal problems in life. It’s highly micromanaged although we are working from home - more...
● Work-life balanceWork-life balance at PwC is non-existent. You work very long hours, and usually over the weekend. Not to mention, if you’re still trying to qualify. I got paid a decent amount, and learnt a lot on the job
Great company. Welcoming. Efficient. Quick on boarding process. Listen to you. Advise you. Learned a lot. The employees were all very well versed and were good mentors. 
Excellent work balance.  Team working Is highly encouraged which helps to find and correct errors for quality output. PWC has ongoing educative programs for its staff In IT and overall well being of the company. Very exciting. 
ProsWork well be well
Overall very good company to work for with smart people, great clients, solid pay and benefits.  The part of the organization where I was employed did not live up to the top tier reputation PwC enjoys in other parts of their business.  It was a sales oriented role and managers actually attached themselves to deals they did not work.  While flexible and competitive, the culture of my group was ineffective at retaining good people.  Since I left, there had been reorganization within this part of the organization.
ProsSmart people, great clients, solid pay and benefits, flexibility, well respected in the marketConsClickish leadership, lack of team culture
No work life balance. Long hours and high pressure is normal in the company. With the hours you work and the pressure you handle. I think this job is under paid 
Good working environment and management overall. Not the best work security but work with employees was pleasant generally and rewarding. Vacation and time off for holidays was extraordinary.
As a Transfer Pricing Consultant, I assist clients in the transfer pricing and other tax-related issues.I spend half my workday doing benchmarking analyses and preparing transfer pricing reports, a.k.a. technical work. The other half of the day is spent on meetings, communication with clients, and discussion with other teammates.The management cares about employees and makes sure we learn as much as we could. However, the pay for entry-level employees is pretty low. The working culture seems to neglect work-life balance and honor overworking, which is not a good thing. The office is pretty international – most of my teammates already had abroad experiences.To me, the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers because I have never been sociable. Although I can manage to have a smooth conversation with my clients, doing so too much drains my stamina.The most enjoyable part of the job is the technology project. You get to be exposed to the most cutting edge technology tools on the market and you get to do something impactful with it.
ProsGood working environment, job security, advancement opportunitiesConsLong working hours, low pay for entry-level employees
PwC is a great place to start your career, grow and learn. I was exposed to so many clients and accounting matters and was given opportunity to advance quickly. 
12-16 hour days, lack of communication/direction from management  which lead to no understanding of overall goals/direction of the team or vertical. 
Prosremote work is greatConsextremely demanding and no worklife balance, way to many social justice warriors
There will be a lot of learning, and a lot of late nights. The one thing that made me enjoy my time at PwC was that you had no choice but to progress. 
You are a number and nothing more. The company breeds narcissism and relies on the buy in of sheep who are happy working for less than an effective minimum wage as long they keep hearing that they are the best and the brightest. Get the name on your resume and then get out. If you stay past manager you will be grossly underpaid compared to your peers who left.
I worked at PwC for roughly three years prior to being screwed over when simply asking questions about potentially needing to take some unpaid medical leave. They forced me out and then looked for ways to get rid of me. In their termination letter, they blatantly lied about their reason for termination AND I HAVE PROOF.On top of that, promotions are rare and nearly impossible to earn even though it's not exactly a hierarchical system. Promotions can be given without any duties shifting or needing people to manage. Management, evaluation after evaluation, downplayed my accomplishments and raises didn't even keep up with inflation.

ProsBenefitsConsLong Hours and Utilization
Good place to start your career. High stress environment but compensated well and learned a lot. Culture is fast paced, but that is to be expected. Weight of the name seems to carry value when applying for jobs.  
The people and personal development / growth made working at this company great. Working with people who are all driven to succeed and who you can connect with in and outside of work. Also the company put you in an environment to grow and succeed with trainings and mentor ship programs. The bad was the politics of the company and management at times played favorites depending on the person. Another bad was during certain times of year non existent work/life balance.
As long as you’re OK working hard and paying your dues it’s a great company to work for. Experience outside the firm is not as valued as experience inside the firm – which can be frustrating for career advancement. If you get in with a good team it is a terrific place to work. 
Great place to develop and learn a lot about multiple industries. The culture is collaborative and the leadership is very communicative. I would highly recommend working there.

ProsUn excelente lugar para comenzar y hacer una carrera laboral.ConsComo parte de la naturaleza de la contabilidad pública, hay que dedicarle demasiadas horas al trabajo.
I got audit jobs on variety of industries, sizes, sections and supervisors. You won’t get bored there. Intensive former Training started before busy season. Fieldworker feedback was ongoing. Two way assessments past busy season is an unique culture: direct supervisors and their trainees gave feedback to each other which was applied to all levels from associates to partners. People get smarter on both communication and technical skills through such process. Asto the hours and loads, It helps to improve. No more no less than a regular cpa form.
ProsProfessionalisms and diversityConsCould be intense with long hours.
Working at PwC was exciting at first, I experience a lot of racism and discrimination.  They use up and then they let you go. I have no more to say take this and use it.
Great salary and flexibility, but high-stress job, especially during busy season. Summers are great in terms of low-stress, and if not assigned on a job, you can potentially have days/weeks off with pay.
Pwc is an amazing company where I’ve met amazing people who have helped my grow both my technical and soft skills. Without what I learned at PwC I wouldn’t say that I wouldn’t be the person that I am today.

"Good Knowledge training .A typical day start with Agile meeting and the work is assigned to you and you can make the choice of completion using the tools"
Great if you like getting yelled each day by directors, yes I said yelled at. Discrimination,  boys club, this place is the typical h*ll for lack of better term and honestly I'd rather never thing about david sisko and his financial services practice ever again.
The firm expects associates to hit the ground running and deliver a quality product to clients.  For individuals who are self-starters and enjoy a fast-paced environment with ample opportunity to excel based on your own initiative, this is an excellent place to thrive.
ProsGreat benefits, access to partners, opportunities for advancement.ConsSome divisions may require heavy travel depending on the market.
I love the flexibility and the try very hard to be inclusive! At least in my personal experience, my managers in various positions held tried to maintain open dialogue.

Great group management was good, like a family plenty of fun didn't mind coming to work a real pleasure. Always offering new an fun IT related things to do.
PwC is an excellent  company to work for.  The company is filled with professional talented individuals.  PwC has many outlets for learning and growing to advance your career.
ProsPeople
Especially for new graduates this company exposed me to many different types of businesses and clients. I worked as a pricing analyst and the work was intense but there were definitely downtimes and you are able to learn new things and interact with other groups within the firm.
They don't pay you enough. They expect you to work 24*7. Once my manager said, you are young and just graduated, you don't have family, what will you do when you go back home. We were expected to work till 10 in the night.
The management team are hard working people who put forth measures that aid/ease and make tasks achievable. The working environment is on point and will love to work with them always.
PwC can be very demanding at times but overall has some pros and cons about their work environment. Busy season can be very hard at times with having to work on weekends and long weeks. Ultimately be ready to go 100 mph everyday and build your network.
Great place to grow your career working on large enterprise transformations for some of the largest clients in the market. People are very caring for eachother.
Excellent place to work, the culture is great, even for a contract employee. they provide training and managers are always willing to help and guide, lots of free lunch and cup cakes. pay is also great.
Great firm with very good firm culture.  Heavy emphasis on digital upskilling which is extremely valuable in current market.  Opportunities for advancement.
The jobs for Contractors are cutthroat. For me, it was a bait and switch tactic (hired for one position, changed completely when came aboard/on-site). The company did not provide space for us to sit and the company employees were very very rude. I had a project manager that was a complete — , very disorganized, rude and would often have meltdowns. the compensation was ok but not worth the grief.
When interning at PwC they treat you like you are already a member of the firm. The work is challenging and they expect a lot from you but the culture is incredible.
A really great place to work and learn. Can be demanding at times and may have higher turnover at the lower levels. Definitely a great company, and there is always room for more growth for everyone here.
No longer work there.  They say there is work life balance but only for select people.  They pay you the minimum amount even though you give 100%.  Can’t say I recommend working for PwC
As with any firm or company, there are pros and cons. However, my experience was a pretty positive one at PwC. I wouldn't tell anyone to shy away from applying and or working there because I do believe much of the experience is up to the individual.
This company is a great company to work for. You learn a lot very quickly and you are given ample opportunity to advance your career. Travel as a consultant is expected 80-100%.
I was a contractor/consultant with PwC in November & December 2019.  I traveled to the customer’s HQ for 6 weeks and we were able to learn much about the business as well as identify some areas of opportunity.  The client/customer was very good to work with.
"Very little regard for work-life balance.Grueling travel schedule.Highly driven and intelligent people. Fierce competition embedded in a feudal framework."
The environment pushes you to perform, elevate past hurdles, and critically solve issues as they appear.  Although it can be a stressful environment, the teams work well together and employee satisfaction is important.
The firm is very productive and I learned many new technologies. Workplace culture is nice. I have enjoyed each moment working in the organization. Totally very satisfied.

I have always felt supported and cared about .  PwC is a great place to work and grow.  You are surrounded by highly educated, innovative professionals.
Strong functions , leadership willing to listen and learn and always ready to invest in employees . There is focus on improving work life balance as well
Working at PwC requires being available most of the time and very responsive. The people are nice in the group but are very demanding. Relatively large group.
Work culture was pretty terrible with manager more concerned about what's going on in personal life. Bizarre to say the least. Lots of cussing going on which I wasn't feeling.
"There is no substitute for furthering your career, but incoming hires should proactively take care to maintain work/life balance and save your energy for busy periods. Take advantage of every perk, and say ""yes"" to opportunities; you will be exposed to an incredible body of work and experience."
If I could sue them I would. My experience here was a total nightmare, racism, abuse, working with incompetent managers etc. Low pay, long hours, no work life balance, all what they advertise is lies. They lie to their clients, give them low quality work etc. Worst place I have ever worked at.
Great culture, endless opportunities, diverse (in mostly metro cities) terrible work life balance, very little mobility opportunities among lines of services.
Opportunity to grow and learn, but must like intensive and fast paced environment. If yes, you will be rewarded, plus have potential for upward movement.
ProsInnovativeConsLong hours
Culture is great, however coming in as an experienced hire I did not feel like there was a great emphasis on your skills versus campus hires. Technical skills are not very broad within the firm in my area of work and I did not feel as though there was much attention paid to my skillset and I did not feel as though I was being utilized to my full capacity by those who place you on projects. It is difficult to grow technical skills outside of offerings the firm provides through partnerships they have for pitching software to clients. Pay is virtually non negotiable and was placed at a level a campus hire with no experience reaches in 1 year while I had roughly 3.5/4 years of experience when I joined; no bonus was offered at my level unless you were a campus hire.
Great place to work for. You'll get an invaluable exposure to varied things that will help you become a better professional. Your supervisor will always be very supportive of you.
Open-concept, hot-seats office. A dynamic working culture that involves multiple ongoing projects. Well-equipped discussion rooms for facilitating meetings and discussions. Hard to maintain work-life balance as there is a tendency to OT continuously. Depending on the department you're in, the culture is usually vibrant and it makes work fulfilling.
Usually shifts are much longer than 8 hours, so be prepared to work all day and sometimes over the weekend. The workplace can be fun because most people are in their 20s and 30s, great place to learn.
Good collegial experience. Fast pace. This is a good consulting experience in my area of expertise. The team is efficient and highly productive. It is good to work with them.
PwC is a highly innovative and inclusive atmosphere that is accepting of all backgrounds because everyone working there brought new and exciting ideas that helped the firm grow.
PwC provides a platform to work on real world client problems that is constantly changing environment. You get exposed to all phases of a problem solving - Define, Design, Strategy, Implementation, Run and Operate.

Horrible workplace, very homogeneous, little diversity of person and thought! Employees wear their hours worked as a badge of honor. No respect for a work-life balance. People tell you what you want to hear, and talk behind your back.
PWC has the state of the art learning facilities and resources to grow your career. They hire the most qualified individuals. They allow employees to work from home and promote a work life balance work environment.
very cultural and fun environment to work in. easy going and learning ability to grow is very easy. Ability to interact with management is very easy going
"This company is really big, and I guess it really depends on where you land and what kind of leadership you get. My experience is with really bad managers that do not really care about the developer and cave to the business demands and the piled up pressure on the ""Agile"" teams. I put Agile that way because that is the other big problem. The Agile process is absolutely broken and really works for the business and not for the teams. The general mood is not good at all and that also play a role in the overall work experience. I won't recommend this company because my experience here has been really frustrating, but you might get lucky or tune up with the culture here and enjoy it anyways."
The workplace culture allows you exposure to many different businesses and their processes.  There is an opportunity to learn a lot, but, there is little work life balance, and work culture provides little time for development.
"If you can be successful in a very traditional professional services firm, where your talent and personality must fit within a narrow box of acceptable norms, and every day is like an episode of Survivor, you will do great here! If you enjoy getting input for your work from 5 to 12 people, you'll love it. If you want to be told your past 10+ years of experience is irrelevant because the PwC way is unique, you'll shine. If you're fine with your well-researched ideas being thrown out because ""that's not what the client wants,"" get ready for 120% utilization. If you find pleasure in having to step over your colleagues to get noticed, you'll move right up the ladder."

Horrible company. Don’t do it. They’re not well Managed and most of the partners are sociopaths, literally. Their systems are from the dark ages and everyone loves to stab each other in the back. They’re really bad.
It's okay. Not to good not too bad. It is a good company to work for. I liked it while I was there. Good business folks to talk to. Good working environment. Not the best company to be contracting with.
"The company is going through a transition in which they are gutting the core offices, moving people to ""Talent Exchange"" and opening more ""Acceleration Centers"". Talent Exchange is full of people who thought the company would take care of them, now to find that they are contract based and there is no guarantee or benefits. Acceleration Centers are built in lower income markets (they can pay people less for the same work) with the promise of moving them to Core after 2 years. Question: if you're gutting core and moving people to talent exchange, how is this promise of movement to core going to be realized?"
PWC offers flexible work environment, however their work in very a competitive market and teams work under high pressure sometimes. Their pay scale is better then others but medical benefits are not greatest.
Being from different school and raise, I was not given same opportunity from my start until I left PwC. Most of my clients were out of town that local hires don’t want to do. Promotion is different because of to much politics. Work life is hard as it is normal for a CPA firm to work from a minimum of 55 hours a week and expected to be at work weekdays and weekends to have the minimum 55 hours.
PwC is large company with a lot of learning opportunities. Has the ability to be in the forefront when it comes to Office Operations. It also offers staff to live a very work life balance that is beneficial to the employee.
Low pay, felt more like a secretary than an analyst. Management said that cared but often said it was out of their control when asked to help or to change anything
There are many opportunities to learn various tax compliance works! You need to be able to do multitasking and pursue strong self problem solving skills in various situations.
Lots of learning potential; work/life balance can be challenging at times.  Lots of opportunity to develop new business and learn more about project financials, recruiting/HR, etc.
It is what everyone says.  The people at PwC are great but the work just sucks.  Its hard because they are always short staffed so the work life balance is non existent.
If you're not hanging out with the cool kids, you and your skills don't matter. In spite of this, it is a place for some incredibly talented  and well meaning folks. Watch your back all the time.

"Heavy workload, ""flexible hours"" translates to flexible for them, not you. The expectation for EA's/ ASC's is to be on call 24/7. Benefits are standard regarding medical, dental and vision. Generous PTO package. Promotions are based on who you know, not how you perform which is disappointing."
This can be a dream job if you work with amicable people.  It can be a tough place to work otherwise.  Long hours are expected frequently but if you are reliable it does provide some flexibility to perform those hours remotely/whenever you want.
After 2.5 years I can say PWC is as great a place to work as it was on day one. I have made a lot of friends and management really cares. Constant support to better yourself and continue your education.
This is a highly professional and technology driven environment.  Very challenging and provides a lot of room for growth / advancement.  Work / Life Balance, as well as diversity and acceptance, is incredibly important to this company.  The only limitations one has at PwC are those one places on ones self.    This is most definitely one of the top three companies in the world in which to be employed.
"A typical day is mostly spent on solving clients' critical issues and working with the team. An inclusive culture is very important where people are rewarded based on the merit.The hardest part of the job is traveling however that's the nature of the beast.Enjoyable part of the job is also traveling and getting to meet people from all over the world."
PwC is very employee conscious. They encourage agile practices, have great benefits for employees, are customer focused. Greatly advanced in technology  and like to encourage that employees are on top of their game.
Innovation and digital skills are top priorities, the company shuts down during key holidays to allow employees to recharge. The firm has strong diversity programs
Very good in improving professionalism top to down. Its had a meaningful impact on my career. I really want to work here again sometime in my career just very long hours
no much training, self taught, lots of experience and opportunities on training the outsourcing team, good work culture . good communication among the team
Great firm to work for.Competitive environment with opportunity to work in different technologies.Good growth in terms of position and compensation.Supportive management.
"As with any consulting firm, life at PwC varies. One day it can be hectic, the next calm. If you find yourself in an industry/practice you do not like, it is extremely difficult to pivot. This is great if you find something you love. Otherwise, it can be quite the killer with long hours.  PwC does provide flexibility to work from home when you're not at the client site.  Management tries new ideas to increase learning like improving automation capabilities. However, time is not truly set aside from client work and people are not able to learn these skillsets without adding to already long workdays. Most of the time, teams find easy ways to accomplish management goals on paper, while breaking the spirit of the activity. You can't really blame the teams that do this due to the already large demands placed upon them."
PwC is one of the few companies which can provide you the opportunity to learn and grow at top clients. You learn all the aspects of a project - Strategy, Design, Implementation and operationlization.
No work life balance. Only join if you are an all rounder and super-smart. Communication skills are very important. Most supervisors are good and helpful but some may be rude. Many a times you will be shared with different teams and will be expected to work in a totally different technology, subject-matter and would be expected to adapt and still do an excellent job

"If you find the right opportunity then it's a very good place to grow as the company gives lot of opportunities to learn. New technology. But there is no work life balance."

I was able to learn different sectors of risk that I had previously been unaware of. We worked on a project basis with each client. It is a very team orientated culture.
"I worked for PwC for more than a decade, so there were enough positives to keep me there, however, there is one significant flaw in the firm that can affect anyone at any time. Promotions to management grades tend to be made on the strength of length of tenure, technical knowledge and/ or networking, and not on management skills. Consequently there are often issues with decisions made by people who are not skilled in managing people and teams. You can be lucky to get a manager who has the skills or you may be unlucky. The most obvious sign that all is not well is PwC's decision to split the roles of Line Manager and People Manager, a role that is normally done by one job holder in companies where management skills are much stronger. Because this has been a long term issue, many of the most senior people are under-skilled and perpetuate the situation by hiring and promoting more people with poor management skills. The consequences are many and varied examples being- people competing instead of working as a team, being defensive and indecisive and decision-making lacking objectivity and adequate preliminary information gathering. This causes significant additional costs to the firm.  The practical implementation and maintenance of the firm's stated culture, that is in theory very good but in practice suffers from  the same issues. When tested, senior people rather than juniors tend to fall short of standards. Having said that, if you are lucky to get a good line manager, then life-work balance is fine and results are good, failures are few, such that the firm benefits as - more..."

Everyone at PwC was very supportive and helpful in my personal and professional development. The culture was fast pace and I learnt a lot from everyone.
You get to have work from home days and decent vacation days. They have awesome firm closure but when it's the season, it's a lot of work. You can get to do work at home if needed.
Work culture, diversity, inclusiveness, appreciation for contribution are excellent. The leaders I worked with had clarity of vision, enabled teams to collaborate and bring out the best.
"I enjoyed working at PwC especially planning events and training workshops, responding to client inquiries over the phone or emails.  There were efforts made by management to ensure that employees also got a break from the usual work environment, by scheduling once-a-week work-from-home days."
PwC is an arrogant place.. Very hierarchical and old school.. They do have very smart folks but inflexibility and attitude of the place got to change..
Benefits are a big perk of this job. Job security is pretty good as well. For me, its the nature of the work that is killer. Great company to work for though.
I was able to intern with PwC for the past two summers while I was in college and it always felt like I was a part of a big family. The number of resources at your disposal is mind-boggling.
do not get promoted based on good performance, IFS is not a good place to be in the company, client service is treated much better and the bonus and structure is better
The culture at Best Company is by far the greatest asset. You can tell that they truly care about the happiness of their employees. It's a really relaxed and calm environment, even though the work we do can be fast paced. I don't dread coming into work on Monday mornings and the managers are extremely patient and understanding.
Career progression is extremely slow and arbitrary. Compensation is hardly tied to skills and effort. Management is often an inconvenience and misuses resources, unable to even remotely understand the projects they are allegedly managing. Ideas to make operations more efficient are frequently ignored as management self-assuredly causes delays which lower staff must work to resolve over their weekends.
Long hours and poor logistic. There is no strategy behind the assignments. Pay is good but not good for the hours we work. Paid holiday is 3 weeks but I often can’t use them.
"Productive workplaceI worked at PwC full-time for more than 4 years Pros Teaches you how to get work done in a professional manner, competitive salary right out of undergrad"
This is an incredible internship! The pay is great. The managers are extremely helpful. Everyone at PwC wants you to excel and be part of the team. Great place to work!
Great place to work an advance professional setting top of class in accounting and finance management and has the top companies in the United States as clients! Great employers growing expanding and servicing!
"Management is very good at auditing, but they are terrible at the only thing they are supposed to do – managing people. You will be given 40 hours to finish 100 hour assignments with half the people needed, and if you can’t do it, they will blame you for not being „efficient” enough. Nobody is going to appreciate you for your hard work. People have their pay raises and bonuses cut, their overtime pay rejected (meaning you will work overtime, but not get paid for it), because management is incapable of evaluating how much time it takes to complete certain tasks, especially when problems arise. You will be overworked and underpaid, and fed by the lie that it’s all worth it because you learn so much. The truth is, if you want to learn about auditing, this is not the place to do it. If you only care about money, other Big4 companies pay better. You won’t be treated better at any of them though.The managers and partners do their best to make auditing more and more difficult, finding new ways to increase the workload without giving more time to actually complete the tasks. The directors keep bringing in new business without evaluating if there are any people left to actually do the work. Some seniors and managers look down on newcomers, expecting them to know everything without teaching them anything. If they disagree and speak up against their malpractices, they will be treated unfairly. It’s a toxic environment. Sorry I had to write this but if you are planning of working there you deserve to know what you’re signing up for."
You will work hard on a daily basis, but you are given a sufficient amount of PTO to balance it out. There will be plenty of meetings and planning, depending on your level. You will meet and work in a truly diverse organization.
PwC is a great place to work and the culture is very laid back, but if you're in the LA M&A practice and want to reduce the travel to a minimum or take a break from it, it's very hard given the lack of clients in the area.
