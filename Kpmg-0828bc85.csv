Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
What is the best part of working at the company?Culture awareness is simply the best.  Pay is a bit lower than other big 4 but great people What is the most stressful part about working at the company?In the administrative field is working with new hires that don’t know what they need What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Great work environment. Leadership is good. Everyone is allowed to be themselves and is welcomed. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Dealing with various people at various levels with administrative work.
great place to grow and work! Great culture and management, great benefits! the management always ready to support you and help you with any type of inquiries. 
Everyone is super helpful and you will always learn! There’s lots of resources to keep learning! Coworkers are friendly and helpful! Busy season can get stressful but if you like what you do it won’t be bad!
the direct manager is quite good, everyone around is sociable and happy but sometimes it's very stressful, I cried a lot while working here, but after crying, I tried much harder, trying to complete the work. work and earn money to support the family.
You work relatively long hours during busy season, but have more flexibility as you become more experienced within the Company. Audit was a great place to start my career, but gets monotonous after a few years.
ProsWork alongside many other young professionals, plenty of team events, significant opportunities to lead internal/external projects, exposure to senior level executivesConsRelatively long hours, most career big 4 audit lifers have a boring personality
Great place to work! The hours are long and stressful but that is expected in public accounting as an auditor. Remote opportunities and a beautiful office are nice. 
Did not give me the opportunity to shadow and learn but rather threw me to the deep side of pool and expecting me to perform. This is in spite of saying that I have not done this type of work in my previous jobs.Excepted me to develop all the documents, take notes of workshops, solve all the issues, and managers will review and be critical of your work and find faults and use that evidence to give bad review. All Directors and managers were hired from the same consultancy place and so were a close group.Was not happy at all and left as soon as I found a place where they appreciated my experience and gave me the space and support to grow.Will never go back.
ProsLearnt a lot about KPMG processes that helped me later in the careerConssalary, pays below market for junior roles
What is the best part of working at the company?Fellow employees are great to work with, and the benefits are excellent What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Deadlines, but you have that with a lot of jobsWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Professional and hard working, to get the job done
Best day of my life was when I gave my notice.  Worked on a team that had no regard for personal time. As the entire team had been on the client forever and company forever they assumed I automatically knew what they did. Corporate culture of throwing everyone under the bus to get ahead.  I will admit I did learn things I would not have learned else where but for the low pay not worth  the constant stress. 
ProsLearning experienceConsNo work life balance, toxicity
Felt uncomfortable most all of the time around my coworkers and seniors. Felt judged if I had any doubts and saw some rolling eyes when it was literally my SECOND DAY working with client. Never had felt this miserable since highschool, I’m currently seeking therapy because of this job. Was called out multiple times for having no communication with my senior and when I did that person was not emphatic at ALL. In college campus they sell you the idea that they are all the worlds best professionals who are pro employee and when you get the job is the contrary. Could’ve lasted more if only my senior wasnt such a sarcastic and irritable human being. Oh and they have favoritism within the team you’re at.
ProsSaying that you work at a big 4 is a flex within society but the job is not. The lakehouse trainingConsNo work job/flexibility, unorganized work structure was literally unassigned for a month and a half, if you suffer from stress this job will trigger it more, everything is work work work, seniors do not care about the sacrifices that you’ve done, like I said there’s favoritism.
KPMG US is great place to work to learn and grow.Great team and supportive managerThis is one of the best company I have worked and I love working at KPMG
Expect to work long hours. Keep in mind that you need 50 - 60 billable hours per week, not just regular clock-in, clock-out hours. Some people may work well with that kind of requirement, but it was definitely not for me when I was fresh out of college. The team was lovely, really nice people, but the structure of the job itself was very demanding and left little room for work-life balance. I left partially because my efforts to bargain for more work-from-home days for entry-level workers failed. Shortly after my resignation and a few weeks before COVID reached our area, they did increase work-from-home options for entry-level workers, so that may improve your experience if you work there now.
ProsFriendly coworkersConsVery long hours, little work-life balance
I enjoyedworking there because my colleagues were helpful funny nice. Good building goof pay happy overall would recommend not for long time to be honesy
I enjoy working at KPMG the work's been really interesting so far. I developed a good bond early in my career with my colleagues so it made a huge different for me.
ProsWork EnviromentConsShort Breaks
Flexible with personal matters, result driven and provides career growth benefit opportunities to their employees.No micromanaging, only mentors as managers and organization skills becomes key when busy season roles around.
For those who want to experience a lot, it is very good company. However, the amount of time of working varies from assignment, so some people would feel unequal.
Being assigned real estate and partnership entities, I was fortunate to prepare complex tax returns - federal and state - of clients with whom I could gain valuable insight into the intricacies of real estate development. I enjoyed this as one disadvantage of KPMG  can be jumping from client to client without the satisfaction of getting to fully know the client. 
ProsTax, audit and investment assignmentsConsExtremely long work hours
Interaction with people from all around the globe. Opportunity to growth as a professional in many aspects, hard work but good compensation towards the effort invested.
Worst company ever. Best day of my life is when I quit. 80+ hours a week of mind numbing work. Clueless management who doesn’t train, guide, or mentor anyone. 
great mobility opportunities, fair pay, solid benefits, teams have a wider background which adds to a welcoming culture and good collaboration, hours are acceptable
Prosfree vegetarian and vegan lunches, flexible work from home and office arrangementsConsinconsistent performance management
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
They burn through associates like cheap dollar-store candles. They expect 55+ hours for your first year but only want to pay you for 40, but then get mad when you advocate for yourself.
Job is ok, long hours during busy season and can carry throughout the year depending on your assigned engagements. Good opportunities for growth and exit opportunities once your time is up
Proud to be KPMG employee.  I feel great working for KPMG with high values and diversified culture. Thanks for the KPMG Administration and Management such great principles and values.
What is the best part of working at the company?My manager and partner were a delight to work for.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The client was absolutely incompetent, and it was painful to get an answer from them.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Tough to describe.  We were on the client site, and rarely had interaction with other colleagues.What is a typical day like for you at the company?At first, it was rush to get to client's office so you could get a desk - there were only 5 desks for 40 people.  Eventually they slowly added more and more desks.
Great place to work! Lots of opportunities for growth and meet great professionals who share the same goals as you. Lot of work during the busy season but good work life balance outside of busy times.
Decent pay and benefits, but dysfunctional leadership in my department caused undue chaos and stress. Mu job was a hostage situation because everything was deemed a crisis/urgent. Unrealistic and unreasonable expectations were impossible to achieve and there were favorites who got all the raises, promotions and plum assignments. Got too toxic, so I bailed. 
overall, work hours were long, but the experience was worth it. Knowledgeable management, solid coworkers.  Working at different clients expanded your knowledge.
Good place to cut your teeth and get some exposure in a disciplined professional environment. I don't recommend staying in the firm for too long esp. if your specialty is in finance / accounting. This work environment trains you conform to a certain way of thinking which doesn't encourage being a risk taker and hone your broader business skills. 
ProsDecent benefitsConsLack of purpose in the work, Systemically terrible business model for work / life balance (not necessarily a problem of the firm)
What is the best part of working at the company?The people I work with. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?The compensation What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very supportive. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Busy days that are productive and fulfilling.
Great culture, great people. You will learn a lot on the job, but not too much work life balance. Overtime is required during busy season and some of the non-busy time as well. 
What is the best part of working at the company?The company sets you up for success.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Just making sure you reach your goal in a timely manner.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?So many people are friendly, and they will treat you with respect. It feels very employee-centric.What is a typical day like for you at the company?I worked remote so it was just logging in and getting work done without much interruption. There's no micro managing
"Decent Pay but definitely hard work. Prepare for long hard hours at all times of the year ""busy"" season or not. Can get caught up in the bureaucracy or the politics at the office."
"KPMG offers great benefits and PTO, but no daily support, community, or balance.  Communication is terrible, especially if you're new.  It can be hard to get help, and you're ""on call"" at basically any time. "
ProsPto, benefits, hybridConsNo work life balance, low pay, no senior support
Your team members are friendly and supportive, but the 55-hour requirement can be intense if you have anxiety. The pay and benefits are good. Nice company, but the work made me feel sick. 
It was a good place. You get 2 weeks off per year that the firm is shut down so you get that paid every year. Plus your normal PTO. So 4-6 weeks total of PTO. Only complaint is with pay. They are about 30% lower than market rate. The worst part of working there is you are just a number. Unless you are a manager or above, the firm hasn’t really “invested” in you so they don’t really care that much. If that makes sense. Definitely a great place to start your career and gain really good experience. 
A good place to start your career, the pay is bad but people are quite friendly, even the partners. Lots of bureaucracy as with most organizations but overall a good place to work if you don't care about money 
ProsDiscounted LunchConsPoor pay and pension
KPMG really takes care of their employees. They promote taking time off, have many company events, promotes you to learn more and sends you to training and certifications on their dime. The team feels like family.
Like so many other reviews say - good place to start and grow career, but pay is not comensurate with work and work/life balance is non-existent.Pros:- lots of opportunity to learn and grow- good peopleCons:- pay is not competitive- no work/life balance
Great place to start your career. Good pay and benefits. Good work and life balance. Exposure to all areas of accounting and taxation. Exposure to clients in a variety of industries 
Great resource and amazing people at the firm. I would recommend working at KPMG. But keep in mind, it is a Big 4 public accounting firm. Expect low work/life balance and work many hours year round.
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
The hours are long and the pay could have been better though I hear it's improved.  Overall I would say this is a good place to start a career right out of college. 
My best consulting experience with a large firm. I felt challenged with opportunity to grow my business and technical acumen. I started as a Manager and promoted to Sr. Manager in 3 years with many disciplines within numerous business sectors (public services, commercial, etc.)
ProsGreat travel opportunities, good benefits
I was with KPMG for 7 years, overall a great experience. My final 2 years were marked with major changes in leadership, random dismissal of  seasoned professionals.
After going through one busy season, I know that I never want to go through another one. You work 70+ hours for two months and working every weekend. The pay is not worth all the stress you are dealing with. Stay away! 
I worked here 17 years ago. While the work wasn’t for me, it was a great place to start a career. The benefits and extra curricular activities are great. The hours are pretty rough but you know that going in. 
I was in BPG and was paid ok as an intern and terribly for full time but the people are nice. Worked as an intern here but decided not to take full time in that more jobs would pay me more.
nice place a lot of stress for the pay. but overall nice people in there. its a good place to start your carrer in bussines. they treat me well being a foreigner
Worked with different offices in the advisory practice and all locations had the same issues. Many projects were understaffed with unreasonable budgets leading staff to be overworked and under pressure to eat hours. There are many managers who do not take responsibility to over see the engagement and will throw staff under the bus when something goes wrong.
I love KPMG. The growth I have had at this company is absolutely insane and the people I work with are tremendous. My managers are some of the smartest people I have ever met and they are always helping me achieve my goals 
ProsEarly Career Rewards, Great Pay, great peopleConsCan be stressful, long days
Teams i have work with are great. Always helpful and willing to teach.  Benefits are competitive as well. The Audit practice is really cool and always looking for ways to make staff happy. 
Good company, strong culture. Long hours and sometimes mind-numbing projects. Overall it's a good place to start a career, and I'd like to continue here for several years. Beyond that, the time input gets excessive.
KPMG is a great place to learn on the job. There are many opportunities to grow professionally, especially within the Cyber Advisory practice.Benefits are pretty good. Two one-week firm shutdowns, and 4 weeks PTO is solid!Some orgs work well over 40 hours, but it is team dependent. 
The projects you get to work on are great and you definitely learn a lot. The people are kind and helpful, good mentoring too. The pay isn’t that great and is less than the average. 
Brand is the only gain in the long term and culture is completely diluted as home-grown employees are barely any and most workforce is laterally recruited. 
I love the company and the people in it. However, there is no work-life balance if you're in an unorganized engagement, so network as much as possible, especially in Tech Assurance.
Great environment.  Helpful and friendly staff.  Hybrid model and great hours.  There is a lot of PTO in the summer and networking events with collogues. 
Everything “positive” the company says is 100% a lie. Worst culture ever and you can forget about having a work life balance. I highly recommend looking at a different big 4. 
Management is only interested in production and expects you to be available for around 15 hrs to handle BAU activities which includes constant connect at social platform as well.Highly unprofessional in addressing team's connect and senior management's approach is beyond expectations.
Entreprise multinationales très puissante, beaucoup de travail,  beaucoup de stresse  mais j'ai beaucoup apprécié travailler !
"Quite honestly, the people are for the most part great, but overall, it's not the easiest place to work.  Tasks are often assigned with unclear directions and practically no one gives straight answers.  Instead of answering a question, they do know the answer to with ""I'm not sure.""  or ""I don't know."", they give you the answer they do know the answer to, confusing the person to the point where they give up.  It feels like people are speaking from a script sometimes.  The perks are nice, and the environment is friendly, but the scope of the work is foggy.  The management is overworked and the staff is scrambling to manage all their tasks."
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
Nice to join the company as a graduate. but not sufficient guidence to join the middle. Carrer advance is okay but the base salary is pittyful. if you want to earn money, go somewhere else, if you want to learn, here is good
Your work/life balance is basically dependent on luck. You can either work 40s or you can have a year round busy season working 55s and weekends. Don't make any extensive plans for weekends, since they can go up in smoke on Friday afternoon. Clients can sometimes be rude. Promotions are fixed based on timelines. However, looks good on a resume
ProsLearning Opportunities, Generous PTO/Holidays, Managers are niceConsWeekend work, Unpredictability
Fantastic culture, great people, endless learning opportunities, transparency from management and leadership, incredible facilities.  Overall, a wonderful place to work.
Working at KPMG in sustainability, i enjoy the content of my daily work, but the work pressure is intense, work/life balance is off, and the organization's accounting origins (in terms of risk/independence/ethics concerns, administrative work, etc) really take away from my joy of working there,. 
Most of the people are good to work with however the hours are long, the job is stressful and lit lacks a sense of purpose. The pay raises are decent but you could generally make significantly more by leaving. 
KPMG is a great place to work and start your career. Plenty of opportunity for advancement if you are willing to put in the work. Busy season is very challenging and requires long hours.
High workload, low pay, very unorganized company in general. Low chances of promotion if you don't belong in some inner circles, or if you don't sleep around with directors and/or partners. 
KPMG has a young workforce, with most employees below 30 years old. You will be working with a lot of people your age (22-29). This is most helpful during the busy seasons, which can last between 3-6 months. There is an understaffing issue, which does not seem to have a solution in sight. 
ProsPlenty of events, nice officesConsLong busy seasons, more than enough work to go around
What is the best part of working at the company?OpportunitiesWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Hours and expectations; constant cycle of promotion readiness
I enjoyed my short time interning here. Everyone was really nice, up to and including the managers and partner. The company treats their employees well. Pay is low for a starter but that's standard for the big 4 so... 
If you want to work every day for 15 hours +, plus weekend work, this is your place. The only thing to be said about working here is you will learn a lot and have a great mark on your resume for future opportunities. However the turnover is super high and the workplace is getting more and more toxic. I would not recommend this to a friend.
As with any large company with 300K employees, there are many layers of management. Approvals can take a while to secure. Management should eliminate excess layers to streamline. 
ProsGood work. Plenty to learn.ConsShort term perspective. Always about billable hours.
This is a great place for you to start your accounting career. Personally, it is not very fulfilling for me nor are the hours great, but I have learned a lot in my time there and have been supported by a group of great people.
ProsGreat benefits/BonusesConsBusy season, Boring
KPMG has a really strong culture and fosters a sense of belonging. Still functions like your typical consulting firm with similar politics. Promotions to PMD are based a lot on who you know / your network.
I just start the job for 5 months. So my overall thought is good. I have a good start with training and several easy tasks to do and learn along the way. The seniors are very helpful and answer every questions that I have
ProsBenefits, good environment, good place to learnConsLong hour, work over weekend
Excellent for new grads. Very competitive. You’ll learn a lot in a very short period of time and there are a plethora of opportunities when you want to leave 
Although working here can be intense, you will learn a lot about accounting very quickly. You also have many opportunities to advance your career either within the firm or through exit opportunities. The partners at the firm often genuinely care about making public accounting a better industry, although, they are sometimes slow at doing so. 
ProsFree lunches with team at least once a week (or if WFH $50 credit to spend), Work from home most of the time, tons of career advancement opportunitiesConsInconsistent schedule, long hours, Tense culture
Since COVID-19 and office closure-The firm has offered more of a work and life balance . The benefits are also great. Only downside is some departments like Tax are overworked and are losing associates up to managers. 
Overall the company is good in terms of pay and work, however should work on increasing employee benefits and also provide budget for team bonding activities
I was laid off after working there for 10 years.  It is a good company, good benefits but they expect you to keep working overtime, no work life balance and depending on what team you are... Internal politics. 
Pros25 days vacation, work from homeConsLong hours, laid off if they lose accounts
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
Blame it all on the contractor. Anything that goes sideways is the contractor's fault, which is crazy because you are only responsible for the tasks you are provided. Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh.Treated like a task monkey and not allowed to be part of more significant conversations on projects. They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ayDuring the interview, they say you will be part of the team, have a the more significant role, and given 40 hours a week, oh, oh, oh. This is simply not true. The only good thing is at 5 PM, you log off. And when you're done, they make you do it all again. All again. 
wouldn't reccommend because as a seasonal employee for three years they never offered me benefits or pto and then cut me with no warning after working there for three years
Excellent challenging work and skill building with peers, community and clients across all industries,Locations and markets. Flexibility and mobility options. 
ProsContinuous advancement and pay increasesConsLong hours
I learned a lot during a busy season internship. Hours are long but people are nice and answer all the questions you have. It can be stressful especially if deadline is approaching but they pay overtime to their interns and if you work late you can order dinner on a corporate card 
love KPMG people, so nice and supportive. however, it also depends on the team. My friend from the other team had to quit her job because of people in KPMG Boston were not nice and unsupportive.
Work life balance can be challenging at times due to utilization targets and sales tArgets and delivery pressure, but can gain lot of experience with clients
ProsTravel X
As an associate here, I think this place was an excellent start to my career. I loved management here, the career growth opportunities were vast and the network you build is exceptional. Sometimes work life balance can be subpar depending on the project but that is not so bad compared to everything else included.
I enjoyed my time there! My superiors were excellent. 
Work hard and be in good graces with management - good exit opportunities. Make sure you attend the happy hours and make an effort to socialize with management 
KPMG was a great place to work. Very professional environment. Good team of people to work for and with. Excellent benefits. Generous PTO. Model corporation 
Huge work load, you have to constantly prioritize and shift gears in this post 2020  work environment.  Some of the rules that applied pre-pandemic may not apply now - meaning you have to put in more effort to network and sometimes “manage up” in order to protect your workflow and peace of mind. Great benefits.
Friendly atmosphere, helpful nice people. Learned a lot about audits. Long hours, great management and met a lot of people while working at client's sites.    
ProsFree lunches at high end restaurantsConsLong hours, travel to different sites
KPMG pays well and offers good benefits. They also sponsor a lot of company events and socials, which makes more fun. However the hours are long (especially in busy season) and with remote work, I am often in front of my computer everyday with no human interaction. Some people may enjoy that, however I have a hard time with it. Overall I enjoy it. 
KOMG is a good place for technology consultants. New challenges to work, upgrade your skills and likewise your compensation with respect to the market.
It all depends who’s on your team. Favoritism is awful with certain people on my team and leaves me unhappy a lot. Leadership really doesn’t know how efficient people can be or what their day-to-day consists of and they make decisions that do not make sense a lot. 
ProsSome partners are great!ConsCertain partners are awful.
Good place to work. Gained lot of knowledge within project. You will have lot of resources to learn.You can do certification based on your interest .
You learn a lot from different areas but the quantity of work one must do is huge. There has bonises on high seasons but after awhile it gets tiresome.
ProsBonus, free food on high seasonConsYou have an entry hour in the morning but not a set time to leave work
Good company to work for new learning in agile environment.lots of oppurtunity to new learning.compensation below market. Work environment is easy and supportive management.
You will learn a lot. It’s worth it for the resume boost but you must go in with the mindset that this is a necessary boost for your career, not a forever job. Hours can get insane depending on your engagement and manager.
If you aren't cut out for public accounting, then KPMG isn't for you. You'll always be required to work long hours during busy season(s). Your clients may change several times a year, and you'll have to be comfortable with change and making adjustments to your schedule, commute, etc etc. I didn't really like working at KPMG, but I know that it was mainly due to personal reasons. 
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
It’s good to join as a new grad, as you can continue learning stuff and picking up skills after college. The team and managers are relatively young, which is easy to get along with. 
ConsLong busy seasons
Where you can learn from many types of engagements, different kind of industry. Busy season has very long hours definitely. Short of staffs in the busy season. 
Where I learned how NOT to consult but to effectively bill clients.  Direct management was not ethical. They billed clients 70+ hours when they weren't even onsite or allowed onsite because of their behavior.
KPMG is a great place to start your career. If you want to grow at the firm you have to navigate company politics and fiercely advocate for yourself. The work life balance is great and you will have flexibility to work remote depending on your project/client. overall, this is a good firm to work, especially if you're willing to do the extra legwork to get infant of firm leadership and accelerate promotion
Good people overall. Decent salary. Work/life balance strained at times big time. Management often clueless. It all rolls downhill. Life is a big services firm. Some of the others I hear are better. 
Opportunity to work from home is still available but comes at a cost of promotion and salary increase. Internal positions/career pivoting within company is available but can be thwarted by firm policy of 8% salary increase cap. Leaving for an external position can be significantly more lucrative. Firm (like many others) would much rather hire from within to avoid paying extra and training for an external hire.Work/Life balance is a mixed bag because higher performers are those who dedicate 55 hours+. Lots of PTO available outside of tax deadline windows.Student loan payment is a plus.2-4 years here is a good move, then leave for better.
I feel like I'm not adequately compensated but I do enjoy the work that I do. Everyone within the company is delightful, and they set clear expectations. Not sure if this is because of covid, but work-life balance has been great.
The working condition is very good. Nice facilities and amenities. Hierarchy is relatively flat and management is very friendly. Overall a good company
love it! Great learning experience, I feel valued and respected. I'm treated in a fair manner, challenging environment but always supported. I never feel alone. It is a great place to work!
Working at KPMG has taught me a tremendous amount about the Deal Space in a very short period of time. Everyone I've worked with is extremly knowledgable and willing to coach. 
I felt like I was in junior high again when I was forced to do trust hudles (when telling the truth would jeopardize my job) and write lengthy personal essays for goal planning. Also, some of the higher ups have personal agendas that take precedence over what is important for the company. If you don't mind wasting time and being frustrated by these type of things, then I recommend working there. I worked in NYC. Perhaps other locations are different.
Comfortable work environment except for one collrague, who was very impatient and disrespectful. Immediate dupervisor was very knowlegeabe and helpful.
ProsRemote workingConsOne colleague was very disrespectful
The pay and benefits are good, the work life balance... not so much, all depends on your drive and energyNot much work life balance Most of the year need to complete mandatory 50 
Nice environment. I was not there very long (about 3 months) but my time ended when covid hit and they closed the office. But before then it was slow to start bur then picked up quickly 
Low pay, but the experience can be valuable later on. Get to look under the hood at a variety of companies and that can lead to future opportunities. 
good culture depending on team & flexibility. lots of long hours, tax reform hasn't stopped and understaffed which leads to burn out. administrative tasks are a burden.
I am currently employed at KPGM as an Experience Hire Schedule (contractor).  I can honestly say I love my job. My position is 100%  remote, and I have the flexibility that I was looking for when searching for a remote position. I enjoy the team I work with from my leads to the recruiters I work with. I would love to eventually grow with the company.
ProsRemote, great working environment, great opportunity for growth within the company.ConsNot the best benefits for a contractors.
interned during busy season (Jan-March). There was lots of work and we made salary + overtime. You also receive a signing bonus. As a person of color, sense of belonging and company culture was tricky. Interns sometimes also work weekends. Expect to be the coffee person everyday and pay for parking!
Prosdinner on the company, salary & overtime, signing bonusConsno work-life balance, competition among teammates
You will be put infront of the client and you'll need to manage them right away. There is no middleman or support from the firm. This is good when it comes to learning but stressful most of the time. Hence its a good place to build your resume and prepare for your next job. 1 year of KPMG experience is equal to 3 years at another firm
ProsGood place to learnConsBenefits, salary, long hours, stress
Firm advocates for continuous learning and feel appreciated for the work I do. Cons would be internal resources could use more work. Kind of hard navigating internally
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
It's a great place to learn to be a great auditor. Once you advance out of the internship stage, you can earn a decent amount of money. Short amount of time to complete the work. You work with smart people but it is stressful
KPMG is a great place to learn a lot in a short amount of time. You'll get exposure to many different clients and a lot of complex tax technical topics. However, work life balance is super difficult to maintain especially during busy seasons.
Consistently required to work overtime depending on what project you are staffed on. Good health insurance, 401K, and PTO of 20 days + firm-wide holidays. However, there is no such thing as a work-life balance. 
Lots of toxic competitiveness  tied to promotion because there are so few slots per year especially for females. Ever changing incentive plans to retain workers without having to advance them. One of the few forms to have automatic pension plans though.
ProsPensionConsNo advancement
You will learn a lot if you apply yourself, however, the job can be very stressful especially during busy season when you are expected to work until 12AM/1AM.
First there is your day to day job where you have to bill hours. Everything else is done after hours because its not billable: training, proposal writing, meetings, etc.  They eventually ran out of work in my skill set and I was realigned to a new managing director and on the road to wherever my skills took me. I eventually left due to the work/life imbalance.
It’s a fast paced environment, and there’s a lot to learn. Work life balance is poor but that’s public accounting for you. Stay for some and see how it goes
ProsResume builderConsHours
KPMG is a great company to start your career but the hours are insane. you really have to see what your priorities and decide if you want to sacrifice everything to work for them
ProsBonuses, Raises, Good teamsConsLong long long hours
KPMG provides good security and opportunities for growth, as well as in other industries. However,  workers suffer from bad work-life balance which makes the leave-rate high.
Great place to start your career, amazing learning opportunities. Be aware of short stuffed engagements, people just got burned out all the time, many experience health problems due to continuous stress
ProsGreat colleagues Quick advancement Amazing learning opportunitiesConsSuper stressful No work/life balance Low pay, considering hours worked Expect to work on weekends, always overtime without increase in pay
This is a great place to work for people who can be happy working at a desk for most of the time. The benefits are great and people are great. Just can get very boring for people who thrive off interaction with other people.
If you ever read the comic Dilbert and wished that you could work in that type of dysfunctional environment then KPMG is the place for you. I never met any of my team members or my managers. 
ProsNot anyConsUpper management lies through it's teeth, KPMG is constantly in trouble with various agencies, They are also prone to having you train your replacement before laying you off, Expect to be laid off by email.
Learned a lot, but most employees are there to only get the experience, then move on to another less stressful place to work.  Managers were accessible and knowledgeable.  
ProsPeople to learn from.ConsStress.
You work with great people but it is a sweat shop. Turnover is high because you are expected to work 70-80 hours weekly busy season always extended as Wells 
ProsThe people and exit opportunitiesConsLow starting pay until you are a couple years in, Almost near minimum wage with the amount of hours worked.
I learned a lot working at KPMG. It's a great place to start entry level. A lot of great perks such as travel opportunities and a nice starting salary. There is not really any work life balance if that is important to you. 
Pros:- Almost guaranteed career track/promotion schedule-Firm resources-Can be surrounded by really smart peopleCons:- Busy season hours (60-90) for 6+ months of the year-Underpaid-Typically underappreciated
Working with top talent from college could be a competitive but learning experience Staffs are expected to work overtime and make available late nights and weekends However, you are able to work on some of the largest client in public accounting 
Was very good experience but other than that there were minimal benefits. Required to work long hours and for minimal pay as a new hire. Work load never seems to relent.
good work culture, decent talent, average work life balance, good place to start career, good support system, opportunity to learn and grow, compensation could be better.
Bad place to be. Generally, people are overwork. Also, you are just as good as your last deliverables. Bad place to be for any and all minorities who wants to move up to be a partner. 
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
KPMG was a great place to start an accounting career out of college.  The work was demanding but the firm had a lot of activities to keep things fun.  You’ll learn a lot and meet a lot of great contacts to help you later in your career.
ProsExperience, training, atmosphereConsHours
You will learn a lot here and there is opportunities to grow. However, the work environment is very fast paced and stressful at times with heavy work loads. Communication can improve. Expected to work weekends and long nights during busy seasons
Overall rating is okay while work life balance is bad. Will give you experience if you want to advance in your career in accounting. Big Four is always good choice. 
Was there for about 1.5 years. Did not feel like the organization cared for its employees. No culture at all. Pathetic on boarding experience. Joined another Big 4
There’s a lot of learning opportunities for sure, but can be very stressful depending on your positions. There’s a minimum flexibility guaranteed regarding locations and schedules. 
I would really encourage people to join here as a first job, as you can learn very very much and get a lot exposure because you will have interface with client
Prosinteresting workConsno work-life balance
There are many opportunities to learn and grow at KPMG.  Be prepared to work hard and long hours. Work/life balance is a struggle.  Very good compensation and benefits.  
ProsOpportunity to learn and growConsWork/life balance
Relaxed, Learned new things everyday, Management was Great, Workplace Culture was Diverse, Hardest Part of the Job was calling it a day, The most Enjoyable part was clocking in.
ProsGood timesConsLong hours busy season
As a campus intern, you get a lot of guidance and support from mentors. However, there is little room for negotiation or adjustment once you are in and moving around to different service lines seems to be require jumping through many hoops because it is such a big organization. 
KPMG is a good place to work where you are surrounded by smart people. You will learn a lot and get exposure to big clients. Sometimes on bigger engagements you may get lost though as you may only be on 1 workstream and not see the bigger picture of the entire engagement
ProsGood pay, good environment, job securityConsLong hours, little say on projects
Busy work days.  Tons of meetings. Unfortunately, there is are enough resources in the market, but Snr Mgmt is committed to the success of projects.   In the time I have been here, KPMG has allowed us to work from home, provided us with a one time stipend to cover home office expenditures.  Havent had a boring day yet... nor a slow day.The pros outweighs the cons!
ProsSupport of mgmt; money is good; company shutdown periods, summer early start FridaysConslow increases in salary; year end lost of untaken PTOs

ProsBenefício Plano de Saúde excelente.ConsSalário a ser melhorado.
This is PA so you know what you should expect. It's a good place to start your career where you can develop all critical skills with fast pace and steep learning curve. The paid off will show after you leave.
Great place to start career. Great training, really good coworkers. Great growth opportunities. Overall definitely recommend as it is a fantastic way to build your network
Wonderful people to work with and supportive leaders, however diversity and inclusion could use work and pay/benefits for employees is less than competing companies. 
Overall, if you know anything about public accounting, you know the hours are horrendous. This is very much the case. Though you can be flexible with the hours you work, not the amount of hours. During the peak season, don't be surprised working over 70 hours with limited assistance. I will note you learn an immense amount in a short time, there is not enough staff and turnover is quite bad. I will say I really appreciate the colleagues I had, but that is not enough. 
I enjoyed the work and the people. I wish there was more advancement with money. I liked the environment and  the perks that came along with working there
ProsLota of perksConsMore cross training
Good company to work for, leadership was supportive. However, promotion was a curve ball. My current team was awesome in terms of team morale. A lot of hard work and have to network.
ProsTeam morale. Flexibility to be a part of BRGs, great training programConsFalse promises for job advancement
Everyone says that the best part about KPMG are the people and they are right. The job can be very demanding during busy seasons. Clients needs are sometimes put in front of employee needs to the point where life can become miserable.
The culture is great. There is flexibility in terms of hours worked, location and personal reasons are respected. But you will have to compensate for the absence in your free time as most projects are intense with tight timelines. Work life balance although encouraged by leadership often becomes a challenge.Pay and benefits are decent but they are a bit behind competitors. The maternity/paternity leaves are bad. Learning and growth opportunities are good as well. You will have ample resources to enhance your skills. Deserving candidates are often rewarded with promotions or pay bumps/bonuses

Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
honestly a good place to be long, term, short term who really knows because the work we do impacts clients in many places - cybersecurity, audit and spanish.
Overall, there is a clear path to promotion and good benefits. However, pay is not worth it for all the hours you have to work. Your personal experience will depend on the people you work with and the client you are placed on.
Live the people, benefits and advancement opportunities. Work life balance is not great. Pay also not great for the hours you have to work. The people are great to work with though. Very helpful and want you to succeed.
ProsBenefits, opportunities for advancementConsWork life balance, pay
Typical Big 4 firm where most engagements are understaffed and overtime is the norm. Culture is dependent on the team you're working with. It's a great place to get exposure to large clients in different industries but not a great place if you're looking for work/life balance. Good parental leave and PTO but other benefits (health, dental, retirement) are just okay.
ProsGood experience, career advancement, job security, great coworkersConsLong hours, low pay, some teams with toxic management
Work is comparable to other Big 4 firms. Get to work with large clients. Leadership is inclusive and compassionate; however there are Directors who are disrespectful and treat you like a second class citizen.
Great start to career but experience can change just based on who you’re working with. I do appreciate the individuals I have met here in Portland as they are a good personable group.
ProsFood, coffee, flexibilityConsPay
Digital Transformation means outsourcing. They are quick to lay off without notice and while you are busy. This gives employees a false sense of security. 
ProsGood payConsWorkload is intense at times
Communications department has lots of talented professionals - but terrible people managers. If a people manager is well liked, they can get away with anything. I'm still trying to forget that toxic environment. This department also had four Chief Communications Officers come and go within seven years. It was constant change and reorgs - a revolving door for CCOs and the directors they would bring in. They would make drastic changes and then they would leave....hard not to be cynical while working there.
ProsBusiness resource groupsConsConstant change, low pay, and favoritism
A good place to work. The culture here is to bring you in and get you up to speed as quickly as possible to promote yearly. Although grace is given, it is important to take good notes on tasks and processes. You will stick out like a soar thumb if you keep making the same mistakes and ask repetitive questions. Stay plugged in to your A2 that you are assigned to and ask questions for anything you dont understand immediately. Be conscious of your team members time. Also, make sure you bring a good work ethic and set up weekly check ins with your in charge. Enjoyed it but wasn’t for me in the long run
ProsPay, free lunch and dinner (busy season), growth potential, coachingConsBusy season stress( we all know this)
I enjoyed my time at KPMG LLP. I learned a lot about filing records. I was learning about work ethic. Phone protocol, kindness and generosity. I switched lunch hours with my work mates. I enjoyed taking classes on learning new goals. I met a lot of good people. I enjoyed working with the Partners, Attorneys, Paralegals and Secretaries. I enjoyed the conferences, getting fed good foods. 
ProsLearning a lotConsShort breaks
Great Corp culture. Co work treating each other with respectful and appreciation. Working many overtime. Have personal time off days and summer firm shut down which could make my work life balance. 
people are generally nice. good for growthploitics are too muchgrowing paincopycats other big fourneed to comform to their stylepay less then other big 4
ProspeopleConsmanagement
- you mostly will work long hours- minimal access to global standards and practices-Feedback mechanism needs to improve to aid objectivityInequity in recognition and promotion. Favouritism. Exclusionary culture. Talk a good talk about inclusion and diversity, but this is not evident when you look at the leadership.
Glad I did it. Looks good on the resume but tough with everything so understaffed. Constantly critiqued because “they have high standards”. However, these high standards are not attainable while a first year associate while working virtually.
One of the gripes I have with my new group in Data Analytics is that as a Consultant there are no clear scope of performance measurement.  As a consultant you may hop on a project and do it all... sell, project manage, analytics, and develop.  Come time for performance review, I am the same in leadership's eye as the next Consultant whom may just sell and project manage.  The perks are good and salary is average-to-low relative to other consulting firms.  
ProsCorporate perksConsaverage-to-low salary
Team fosters a collarborative work environment, and enables employees to maintain extracurricular interests. Compensation is low, audit industry wide.
great place to work. great company for a new grad or inexperienced worker starting out. Would do more research regarding specific position and network early on
"The pay was solid but the biggest issue I have is the culture here and management. I worked as a temp/contractor and the management was always hounding you and they made you fear them, they made me worry all the time I would lose my job for the smallest imperfection. They expect perfection and will berate you if you are not a machine. Another negative is how much they would force you to work. Come in at 10 am and staying until 1 am was normaI during busy season. I was let go and if you are a contractor/temp they make you feel like an outsider and not welcome in their little ""cliques."" The only good thing was the pay was solid with the amount of overtime you can build up here."
Prosgood pay, nice officeConsclique like culture, overworked, sense of fear all the time
Great firm name recognition and upward mobility. Under market pay. Advisory pays way better than audit. There is great flexibility in terms of scheduling in advisory but not in audit. 
KPMG - It's the best!  Lots of great stuff happens here.  Lots of help from Managers.  They totally support you.  We hang out together and drink lots of beer!
ProsKPMG It's the BestConsKPMG It's the Best
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
Good but not too much exposure! For client facing roles, it is good but for back office not good! So be cautious and look for the client facing roles in general!
KPMG is a typical consulting firm. The firm provides adequate compensation and benefits. Have to work hard for job advancement and work/life balance. 
If you work for a good partner, you'll have a good experience.  If you work for a partner who is toxic, your life will be very rough, and no one can or will do anything about it, as long as they bring in the money.  I worked for one partner who kicked holes in the wall.  There was a senior manager who was proud that they'd stopped throwing things at staff.  Another manager ran up and down the hallways to try and get to the workload.   People in nearby groups seemed much calmer and happier, even though it was the same firm.
ProsFlexibility, affordable insuranceConsLong hours, unfair pay
I stayed as long as I did because of the people. Almost everyone I worked with I thoroughly enjoyed. It was a work hard play hard environment, however, once COVID 19 hit the 'fun'/ worthwhile aspects of the job disappeared. I put way too much time and energy into a job that I didn't receive any fulfillment for and wasn't passionate about.
ProsAbility to work your way upConsWork/Life balance
Your experience depends heavily on the teams you’re assigned to, which change with each engagement. Depending on the senior/manager, your experience could be great or a nightmare. 
Sure, it's a job.  Bathrooms are clean.  There is free, institutional coffee.  Maybe even free parking.But you have a life.  You need to get moving. 
ProsLearn many meaningless buzz words, acronyms, and the value of bluffing well.ConsToo may cons to list in this short space.
I will recommend KPMG to anyone who qualifies to work there. Good company culture and no barrier between you and your superiors. They are always ready to assist in any work capacity. 
ProsVery good resource personsConsNone for me
My experience at KPMG in the Audit practice has been overall positive. The ability to work with senior management on a daily basis, the amount of learning opportunities, and the people I get to work with are excellent. The work/life balance can be very hard on families and individuals but you just need to ensure you speak up if you don't want to miss a special occasion or event. You do still have to put in the hours but I've found my team to be flexible in ensuring that I get to spend quality time with my family.
The firm is going back 10 years and outsourcing and offshoring the back office - doomed to repeat itself.   Management has no regard for anyone not producing revenue…shame
Worst firm to work foreverExtremely toxic environment.. selfish Unequal standards exist across organizational levels, Think of it as lobbying within the firm; and the you have no Boyce Extremely poor & no recognition at all  for all the work
You make work hard, But you're well taken care of in the end and treated like you have been there for years.But if management ask for something in a timely manner it is expected.  
ProsUpper Management are great to work with.ConsNever say you can't do something.
Working at KPMG I learned a lot but I’m not sure I always felt set up for success. Managers are quick to blame staff for their decision to under allocate resources to jobs. Keep the Partners Money Growing. 
ProsCPA Bonus, PTO if you can take itConsBusy season, cliques
There were a lot of good folks. Some processes were overly combursome. Like most larger companies there were silos of folks that were needed to complete projects. Knowing how to engage those teams was not always easy. 
The pace is exhausting and the pay is low.However you progress fast and you get a lot of responsibilities.You learn a lot including a lot of presentations.
Good company to start your carrer right after college. As expected busy hours during a busy season and sometimes through out the year depending on the client year end.
Great way to learn a lot very quickly. However, the expectations of working 50-60 hours as a minimum gets old really quick. Unreasonable expectations of seniors. 
great place to work and grow a career by working on different projects.  relationships and technical knowledge are key to advancing within the firm but that is something that you can achieve.
A professional work environment with several avenues for growth.  Working here will open new opportunities. As an alumnus, you are always part of the KPMG family.
Great company great company and benefits. Training is difficult. Everything is online- you have a lot of tutorials and resources but it took weeks. The culture is ok. Some old timers there that are in a boys club. 
ProsWork life balanceConsTraining
Great place to advance career. However, highly understaffed with high unrealistic expectation for the remaining staffs to push through the deadlines with lack of guidances. Wished they have better resource allocation system as currently working alone (prior team members are all rolled out from the engagement or unavailable) as an A2 experienced hire and reporting to a senior manager who's busy working for multiple other engagements is quite overwhelming. 
ProsOvertime meals and miscellaneous perksConsWork life balance
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
Good collaboration between colleges, supportive management, opportunities and time for self-development and learning, interesting projects, any requirements are open for discussion
It was an okay place to work. nothing spectacular. Management will disrespect you but more than likely you will be told to expect that off the bat. They have fun engagement activities sometimes.
ProsFun engagement activitiesConsHigh stress
Even though I may have not directly developed the flow charts I worked directly with the processes and helped me learn a lot about them and how they could translate to work of the future
Career growth is very difficult even if you have all the boxes checked and due diligence completed. Internal politics are ever changing and frustrating to maneuver. I was there 15 years and promoted at year 8.
ProsPeople are generally good and supportive.ConsLeadership is not transparent on direction and sometimes expectations
This is a public accounting firm with the global brand. With that being said seasonal long hours are expected. However, the firm cares and you may constantly feel it. I am working with amazing people. Even in the pandemic world you feel cared and connected to your employer. The professional development is constantly supported. 
The work is good and you get a lot of exposure particularly when you get to speak with executives. However, there's a required face time at some units and the hours are long for the pay.
ProsFree lunchConsLong hours for certain units are expected
Like every other corporate job they do not care about you. Management lacks communication, and you will not move up or advance. The job  was not very hard and it had a laid back atmosphere.
ProsFree meal during shifts
Matured professionally working on many exciting initiatives. Gained experience  in many new technologies that made me very competitive in the market. 
Amazing curve of learning. At KPMG there is a culture of feedback that makes you grow professionally. You always want to go above and beyond. Excellent management and excellent follow up of your improvements. 
ProsHighly demand, always looking for perfect workConsStressful, lots of hours
Excelente empresa, muy profesional, muy buenas capacitaciones, muy buen ambiente, los salarios se hacen competitivos con el tiempo, pero hay que tener paciencia para alacanzarlos.
ProsAsociación solidarista, buen ambiente, profesionalConsHay que esperar mucho tiempo para alcanzar salarios competitivos
Worked as a technical support specialist/Help desk technician st the NSC in St.Louis.  I was a contractor and worked there for about 6 months. I was told I would be hired on as a full time employee after 3 months but it was quickly apparent that that was not the case. Several other contractors had been working there for over a year and still had not been converted to full time employees with benefits. It seems crazy to work for a company for a year plus and not have decent benefits or pto because you’re a contractor. And it became pretty clear that I would be in that position for a while. 
ProsLunch was catered often. Lots of opportunity for overtimeConsOften to busy to take 15 minute break. Asked to work through lunch or to work late often.
Great place to work and to start your career. A lot of pressure as usual in a Big 4 consulting firm. Little work/life balance, but at least the salary is decent. 
Great place to start your career at. But staying long term is not for everyone. There are tons of learning opportunities and if you are a go-getter and high-achiever (and can work A LOT), you will do great here. The work can be a bit too demanding and stressful for some, though. 
ProsLearning Opportunities, NetworkingConsWork/Life Balance, Can be stressful and demanding
Understaffed and too much work thats common with the industry. Budget hours shrink year after year and will require you to eat hours even if they say not to do so.
KPMG has been a great place for me to start my career. The management teams here have ensured that I am learning various skills that I receive exposure to many different clients and industries for my benefit. The company is extremely flexible when working to make sure that you are pursing the goals that you would like within the bounds of the jobs. There are times when I feel like I am being asked to, or are actively engaging in projects that call for more experience. In those cases I feel like I am being under compensated as I am doing work at a higher level than what I am being paid to do. 
Prosflexibility in the work and client portfolio, great benefits, industry exposure, upskilling is supported and fundedConslong working hours, under compensated for certain work, lots of internal training
If you are willing to learn and grow then this is the company for you.  There are many opportunities to excel. It’s essential to be able to multitask as you will have many projects.  There will never be a dull day. 
ProsBenefitsConsLong work hours for some
Job security. Flexibility ....Nationally standing up for inequalities...Great Perks...Decent Pay...Management needs to broaden their perspective. Advancement is very hard ..All remote position post covid 
ProsFlexibility, Decent Pay, Great PerksConsPromotion are next to none
KPMG is a very good company to grow, you can develop your career inside or if you want to work in another company. Also you can have very good co-workers 
ProsYou can learn and growConsYou sacrifice a lot of time working
Was told the job was going to be for a minimum of a year.  Was cut loose just after 8 months.  I was banking on that last four months of employment.  I had multiple on going issues with payroll.  Not deducting taxes from check correctly.  Overall this is the worst place I have ever worked.  Would never take another position here if offered one again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Experience worth having. Every team is managed a bit differently. The culture is very strong and there’s a sense of belonging. The stress level is quite high through

Not worth it. Long hours. Highly stressed environment once you’re promoted to senior. High performance culture. Typical political big 4 environment. Lots of networking events 
My position was in-house, examining and accounting for the US consulting operations, lots of hours of course, lots of humility needed as learning curve is steep, if you stick to it you’ll be amazed at your professional growth
ProsFun co workersConsStress
KPMG is a great place to work for professionals that are go getters and can succeed with little supervision. The firm enables you to grow as a person and professional in the same time. Everybody that I know is very friendly and willing to help. 
Pros4th July and Christmas close down for a weekConsHealthcare is a little pricey
A great job depending on your manager.  Days were mostly long before COVID, but working from home turned me into a 24 hour employee.Do-as-I-say not as I do manager.  Was never around and made sure he made you feel horrible before he left early.
ProsSummer hours, flex timeConsmanagement
I enjoyed my time working at KPMG. Such nice colleagues and a great atmosphere to work in. KPMG Culture is second to none. It's all about inclusion and welcoming of diversity. The benefits are great. They want you to be healthy and give you time for that daily. The overall attitude of KPMG's upper management gives you the feeling they actually DO care about their employees first and foremost. It is the best company I have worked for, by far, when it comes to how you're treated.
ProsFree Dinner during Busy season
Stressful job with a significant hour requirement during busy season. But good experience, you will learn a lot and you will have lots of opportunity to grow in your career. 
Long hours (obviously). Decent bennies. Good place to start your career. Get that big 4 stamp on the resume. Can lead to better opportunities in industry. 
Typical Big 4 experience. Eager high achievers getting overworked and underpaid. Busy season is not a season, you stay in overtime most of the year. Learned a lot but until the partners and MDs retire and a younger management group is promoted there doesn’t seem to be much changing in the toxic overwork environment. Minimal work life balance but hours flexibility is nice.
ProsBusy season perks, diversity initiatives, mentoringConsHours, management attitude, small bonus
I worked here only for a few weeks, but it is obvious that this is an excellent company.  I can't say enough what a great company this is and I highly recommend it.  I was working from home.  They sent me a laptop and all the equipment I needed to work.  The benefits are amazing.  The company culture is amazing.  The people are amazing.  The pay is amazing.  Work here and you are set for life.
ProsBenefits, pay, training, culture, work from homeConsMust be disciplined since you are working from home. You need to check in like a regular job
Not sure why management feels the need to carry on the charade of big 4 work/life balance. It is a bad joke. Its all meant to seem like you are an important part of the company/team but if that was the case, they should treat you way better. Do your time, and once you find an exit opp, take it. 
ProsResume fluffConsmanagement, hours, work/life balance
Would not recommend to anyone. If you weren’t part of the clique you weren’t accepted. Management were always calling, watching and checking up on you. When you’d ask for work you were told they didn’t have anything but in reviews you were punished for not doing enough work. 
ProsNothingConsEverything
The pay was the first thing that attracted me to the job. I did not get a return offer after my internshio landed because I was not good at interacting.
I enjoyed my time at KPMG and think it is an excellent place to begin a career in the accounting field. The management is very supportive and there is a lot of training to make sure you're up to date. In public accounting, you learn nearly every day, however some of the work is quite tedious.
KPMG was definitely a journey. It seems like the management didn't really care what kind of projects that they took on and what that meant for employees. However, I learned more than I could have imagined, worked with some really smart people, and the benefits are great. You also get a chance to work with other large companies.
ProsBenefits, compensation, people, opportunitiesConsMangagement, hierarchy, long hours
You should know what to expect going in most likely.  Figure out what you want to get out of the experience going in and it will make it more bearable. 
I mean, it's Big 4. At the staff level, the biggest attractions to get in are the possible exit opportunities when you get out. If those opportunities don't show up, then really, it's just a big white-collar factory. But for some people it works out staying in so good for them.Disclaimer: I'm strictly talking at the staff level.
ProsThe biggest pro of any Big 4: what you can get out of it; i.e., exit opportunities if you're in the right groupConsAll the cons of any Big 4.
I loved it, always felt good there, people where usually proactive, they provided resources to help employees continue to grow to help their clients achieve their goals, good team environment.  The building was beautiful.  Client locations where also amazing.
ProsPeople, variety of work and locations, plus learningConsDid not have any
All us secretaries and admin always took care of each other and fill in when needed.  Always celebrated all of our birthdays by going out to nice lunches at Houstons!!  Loved my time at KPMG and miss all my co-workers :)
I enjoyed my time at KPMG and think it is an excellent place to begin a career in the accounting field. The management is very supportive and there is a lot of training to make sure you're up to date.
In public accounting, you learn nearly every day, however some of the work is quite tedious. The hours during busy season are typically quite intense and will require you to place you personal life on hold. Granted this is just the deal with public accounting and is not unique to KPMG. Wages are standard for public accounting but are low compared to industry positions, especially when total hours are factored in.
ProsCompensated meals during busy season, work with young people, most colleagues are fairly intelligent and hardworkingConsHours can be extremely long with high pressure deadlines at busy season
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
KPMG actually values their employees, though your management, compensation, and advancement do not actively reflect it. KPMG has 2 yearly shutdowns, one over Christmas, and the other over 4th of July for a paid week that doesn't count against your vacation time. Surprisingly weak on the benefits and pay side, it is a fun company to work at.
ProsCulture, time-offConsAdvancement, benefits
There are plenty of opportunities to learn and advance in your career. Opportunities are boundless, but be prepared to work 50 hours every week. Things pop up often and management treats everything like a fire drill. Management bends to clients needs without thinking of the strain it puts on their employees. If you are a person who is very career focused, this will be a good place for you to learn and grow. If not, work life balance is not great and you might often feel trapped to your desk all day. 
ProsGrowth and learning opportunitiesConsPressure, stress, don’t feel like you are paid enough at lower levels
KPMG feels like a family from the very beginning. Everyone is welcoming and willing to help you succeed whether you've been there for a month or for 20 years. 
ProsFree lunches, kind staff, fair payConsLong work hours during week
KPMG doesn't have a very strong culture and limited opportunities to grow. Projects are not assigned based on skillset, and advancement in career is slow.
Work life balance is practically non-existent, especially since transitioning to work from home. At this point, basically just trying to hang in there to get enough experience and leave as soon as possible just like most people. 
ProsExperienceConsYou have no life
Working in KPMG’s Deal Advisory space a can be fun and challenging. It all depends on the mindset with with you approach the task. The hours can be tough significantly impacting work life balance but if you have an awesome team you’ll very rarely feel it. The work it’s self is pretty cool; working in the space helps you see lots of different companies and get under the hood of those companies to see how they run and make money. I think it’s invaluable experience but your mileage may vary. All in all I think it’s a great place to start a career in the finance/accounting/consulting space.
All the staff and managers where great but busy season sucked working 60-100 hrs per week and lots of travel. Tons of company happy hrs and events. Great place to start a career and give you the upper-hand when applying to another job. 
ProsLots of Happy Hours and other staff in the officeConsLong hrs, no work life balance
It’s a great place to start a career. Really enjoyed my peer group. The work/life balance does not exist. Definitely not compensated for the amount of overtime provided and very little flexibility.
KPMG is a meat grinder.   The 12 years I worked for them I never say one person retire.   The company gets rid of its aging workforce before they get a chance to retire with full benefits.    One of the worst companies I've ever been associated with.  While there I saw every person hired on with me let go through the years.  By the time the company forced early retirement on me at the age of 57 after 12 years of dedicated service everyone I knew at the company had be let go.   Not a secure place to work for long-term life planning.
ProsThey have a training culture in place.ConsGrinder mentality, and no job security.
The work can vary from fairly interesting to pretty mundane, but the thing that makes KPMG what it is are the people. That is definitely the best part about working here. Besides that, it is a high stress environment with long hours. Management does try to recognize performance though. 
Audit is audit buts it’s the best of the B4 in my opinion.  Career coaches are usually very helpful and care about your growth.                                                                          
ProsTraining, advancement opportunitiesConsWork life balance
Long hours and work life balance is not always great. Schedule can change week to week/month to month due to nature of job. Didn't really have any say about what project you get placed on which isn't always great if you get stuck on a client engagement you don't enjoy. Good benefits and company perks, but pay should have been more compared to industry. People are frequently overworked and burnt out. Trainings were fun and learned a lot, especially when new. Great people - made some great friends. You do learn a ton though because you're forced to so it is a great way to quickly advance your career. There is high turnover at a lot of Big 4 companies.
Working at KPMG was one of the most positive experiences I've had in my professional career. There was an open door policy between staff and management within my team, and the full-time KPMG workers. There didn't seem to be a hierchy among high skilled workers. Everyone maintained a culture of respect and inclusion. This was an amazing place to work.
ProsThe employees themselvesConsI don't really recall there being any real cons.
Fun times with initial manager but not so happy with subsequent manager. Learn alot work hard to meet engagement deliverables and quality work products
ProsExcellent supportive senior managementConsLack of work in some labor categories
Start your career there but get out quickly. Management recycle employees like water bottles. You will work hard but will not get promoted. You will get assigned in engagement based on who you know. During summer you will be scrambling to be assigned.
ProsCompany card, learning, exposure, trainingConsLong hours, stress, no work life balance
"Didn't like my time in there, was a waste of time, bad management and a lot of ""you should know you could have done this"" when nobody explains anything to you"
ProsBig4ConsEverything else
Great place to start a career. Supportive environment which supplies the resources needed to learn and grow a career. So many opportunities especially for those that are driven. 
ProsGreat benefits, tons of small perks, awesome peopleConsLong hours during busy season and can be very stressful
I'm just a intern in KPMG, but my co-worker(or supervisor) told me that they have to work very late so as to complete their assigned jobs. And the payment was just not pleasant.
Great people to work with in most of the teams i have been on, stable job with predictable advancement from assoc to senior to manager to senior manager, but overall too many hours and not enough pay
Long hours and not compensated accordingly. However people are great to work with and learning at such a high pace. Great training is made available to all employees 
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
Great place to get trained and build your career - tough hours but the trade off is worth it. Recommend you stay until senior associate at a minimum. 
Really productive work environment. Hours can be long but only expected. Management listen to your concerns and make allowances if you ever need them.
ProsGood leadershipConsBig firm
Great company to launchpad your company. There are numerous opportunities you can dive into or transfer into once you're in. Just do your part in selling yourself well.
Overall, a great place to be if you want your career to accelerate in high gear. That said, hours can be long, travel can be intense, and the advancement opportunities do create a competitive environment .
ProsSalary, advancement, exposureConsCompetition, conservative “old boys club” management
Management consulting not in focus, hence little motivation to work there, as silos mentality creates road blocker in own development within the consulting department.
ProssadasdConssfdsfdf
Despite National being very pro mental health and inclusive, I found the local office to be quite the opposite.  I have never been treated so poorly by a professional then I was at KPMG. My direct manager was unavailable and unwilling to listen or appreciate mental health concerns. No support offered which is really disappointing for the level of company.  Just a number not a person.
ProsTechnology for working from homeConsLong hours, no support
This is the typical big 4 experience. Long hours but worth your while at the beginning of your career.  You will learn a lot but you will get exhausted.
The firm does not have the Ability to execute a meaningful direction and strategy.  No sense of team or market leadership.  Partners have no interest in driving the business , only how will the be bonused each year.
A lot of time consuming tasks - normally performed by offshore teamsHard to get a proper in-boarding training Promotions every yearVery talented coworkers
ProsReputationConsNo career life balance
I enjoyed my time there. Many nice coworkers the work was efficient but the management team I did not care for. With the team I worked with they were for themselves and made it seem like they didn’t want to help and were annoyed easily 
ProsMeeting new peopleConsManagement
Interning for this company was interesting it was all online so it was tough to pick up information especially when unsure of everything going on in the first place
ProsHourly pay for internsConsBad online environment/ didn’t feel as if I was learning much
The role has its benefits in terms of advancement, flexible hours during the offseason and benefits. However, the compensation is very rigid in terms of not differentiating for performance, as you can expect with a large corporation. It's hit and miss in terms of the how supportive your managers and partners can be. 
ProsPto, flexibility, advancement opportunitiesConsHours, compensation
I’ve been here 5 years now. It’s a great company no complaints. Pay is good and the work is interesting. Would recommend working here to others. The leadership is solid.
ProsGood salaryConsPto could be better
Had fun as a recent undergrad and felt invested in. However, travel and unpredictable schedule was not sustainable.  Nonetheless, I learned a lot and enjoyed my time there. 
I really enjoy the jobs I am placed on and the people I work with. I think the firm does a good job advancing inclusion & diversity programs. One downfall is that I don’t feel compensated for the level of effort I put in, but they’re in the process of changing the way reviews are completed so I’m hopeful it’ll change. 
This company gives you the opportunity to excel and grow depending on your position level. More potentials for staff level management than it is for admin assistants unless you have a 4-year degree and want to move into a staffing position.
ProsMore firm paid holidays.ConsDon't count on generous raises.
Upper management is unrealistic and does not care for lower level employees, middle management is good but the great ones leave to go elsewhere, under paid for big 4.
ProsPto, Holidays, FlexibilityConsManagement, Expectations
Great people, easy commute, beautiful office.  Lots of perks. Volunteer time off which you are given many choices. Also free coffee and milk supplied by the office.
ProsFree lunches, time off for volunteering.ConsCan't eat at my desk after 2pm or at all.
Dogs are the best thing going for the company they are very fun and make the workplace much better to be in and make me want to come in everyday and never call out
Working hard from associate to senior to manager. There is a classic path to partner or you can hop out like so many do after a few years. Big clients, large engagements. Fast paced. Low pay for the hours.
ProsResume builderConsHours and pay
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
Lots of training. Busy, fast paced atmosphere. Great diverse workplace where everyone was welcome. Sorry to leave there but I was laid off due to a COVID reduction in workforce.
ProsParking allowanceConsNone
The firm has excellent benefits, but the culture is something to desire.  If you are not an Associate or above, you will not have a voice and often left out.  They speak on Inclusion and Diversity, but the numbers does not show that.  If you are a minority your chances on succeeding are slim to none.  Please take heed to this advice and do your due diligence before applying or accepting a job with this firm.
ProsFlexibility to work remoteConsCulture and inclusion and diversity doesn't exist.
Performance driven culture. Co workers are very supportive. Many opportunities to learn and good supportive managers and employees are very focused on their work. Since this is accounting, many employees work long hard hours during busy season but the company rewards well. The Short Hills office was a close-knit work culture.
ProsWork recognitionConsLong hours for staff
Nothing special. No raise or bonus. Not much growth while working at this company. Not much support from management either. My team does have the ability to work from home which is nice. 
Good place to start great time family at work feel as home learn alot on the job , professional team members great benefits . alot of work , great bonus, 
ProsLunchConsHealth insurance
I would rate them 5 out of 5 for shelling out professionals. It’s like a production line. They pay good money to train you into a problem-killing machine. BUT in my humble opinion, it’s not worth the toll on your mental health. They’ll put a straw in you, and suck the life out of you, checking to make certain you’re not dead as they do so. Colleague died and got a minute of silence. We continued typing as we stood in “silence”. I quit, met all conditions, but the final emoluments never came. Don’t do it!
ProsFree lunch, paid classes and exams for certificationConsParasitic culture, drains the life out of you, does not pay final emoluments
Your experience will entirely depend on your engagement and/or team. You can be put on an absolute dumpster fire of a project and have a dreadful experience, or you can get put on an excellent project and end up wondering why some of your peers are so stressed and contemplating jumping off a bridge. I was fortunate to be put on a great project and have had an excellent experience thus far. Oth I have heard a couple of my fellow new hires have been put on terrible projects and I genuinely feel bad for them. The concerns i’ve heard are incompetent managers, Senior Associate with little to no accountability for the success of their new associates, and unusually long hours. Overall my experience has been a super positive one. 
ProsBenefits, Pay, FlexibilityConsHours, certain projects
Pros: Diversity, Technology, can work remote, health benefits + pto (day after thanksgiving off + closed christmas week), everyone at every level is issued a firm laptopCons: low pay for a global firm/no annual bonus, micro-managing, too much emphasize on client coding, no training on their systems or new technology they implement, no effort on bringing the group together as a team  
ProsTechnology, can work remote, health benefits + pto (day after thanksgiving off + closed christmas week)Consmicro-managing, too much emphasize on client coding, no training on their systems or technology they use
1) Most days are very busy as you scale up in the organization and involve many hours of calls, work, review and deliverables.2) You learn the technical aspects, such as tax, on the go if you didn't have prior knowledge of the subject matter. There are great training opportunities but these are typically left to certain times of the year.3) The culture is intense, but people are generally very nice and its diverse. However, the time commitment is almost a given and crazy hour weeks are almost expected.4) The Hardest part of my job is hashing out some of the technical aspects of certain exercises or projects, combined with meeting tight deadlines and often having to redo work because of information changes.5) The most enjoyable part of my job are the colleagues and clients, generally.
Pros401k, Perks at Work, PayConsLong hours, occasional toxicity, long (7 days a week of 12+hours) busy season.
everything in the company needs to be changed. Management does not give room for people to grow and will not allow their careers to process to the level that they can. 
KPMG treats anyone under an associate level like they are easily replaceable. There is no office culture or rapport and dedicated staff are severely underpaid. It is nearly impossible to get a promotion or hired for an internal position. I do not recommend this company to anyone who is under the associate level. 
Prosworking remotelyConslow salary, no positive reinforcement
Blame gamePoor work life balance Very prejudiced... CORPORATE HYPOCRISY !!No training people look for your weaknessesSelfish ManagersMust be a narcissist to survive there
ProsSalaryConsHealthcare, poor work life balance, preferences
Love this company. it is a wonderful place to work and everyone work as a team in the company. I truly enjoy working there. I can get time off easily and get paid well for my job.
KPMG Canada is supposed to be in the ''Big 4'' but is really running behind on others, they should really not be considered in the Big 4. Their audit technology is super old, their tools are not up to date and they have a real hard time doing the transition.This is why they mainly target government clients or do very low bids to beat the competition. On top of this, management is super toxic and not diversified. They are really not able to play in the high game lead, not sure why we even compare them to Deloitte or PwC.
ProsWork-Life balanceConslack of diversity, toxic management, not interesting clients, old softwares
Best place to work so you learn and move on..you will have clients in different industries so you will get to know about how these companies are managed.That is a good advantage
ProsDifferent clientConsNo upward movement

As an employee at KPMG you will have access to and interact with experts across industries and business solutions. At the same time you will be valued for the skills and expertise you bring to the table. It is truly a collaborative environment. KPMG also puts tremendous effort in curating a positive and balanced culture. The culture message is extremely well thought out and executed. Overall, a great place to work and learn.
ProsLearning environementConsA ton of travel
Satisfaction goes with what client you get put on and what partner you work for... Your partner can change the whole dynamic of the workplace - every engagement can act as it's own small entity.
"Unlimited advancement opportunitiesLearned more than in collegeCompetitive but team cultureWorking with differrent Managers and Partners reduces ""bad boss"" riskAcceptance and respect from clients"
ProsOpportunityConsHigh-pressure environment
KPMG's a great place to begin a career. You build a solid network and there is training for all analysts with regular social events. The culture has slightly deteriorated due to good people leaving but overall a good experience.
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
Toxic, toxic, toxic!  The people were nice but I could do without the brown-nosing and phony clique's. There's much better places to work with much better leadership and pay. 
ProsEasy workConsToxic
pretty boring at times bc tasks can be very tedious, but it is a good place to gain accounting exp. having good co-workers really changes the atm so be on the look out for that
You’re going to work a lot but having KPMG on your resume will set you for life in the world of corporate accounting. You have to travel to various clients so it’s rare you’re working from the main office. 
ProsGood benefitsConsLong hours
I was an auditor in Los Angeles and I did a lot of work with my team. It was very stressful and didn’t know what to do next. New staff theres a lot to do and hard
ProsYes free foodConsOtot
The work life balance is great and there are always someone out there to guide you and lead you. Pay is good. Good career opportunities with competitive benefits.
At KPMG, be expected to work long hours.  In Hartford, CT, it seems to be on the upper spectrum of hours worked compared to other BIG 4 (EY might be worse).  If you are a decent performer, expect to be promoted on time, within 4.5 years you can be a manager making 100K - quick advancement and pretty common.  Learn quickly on the job.  
ProsQuick AdvancementConsHours, Hours, Hours!
KPMG is a great place to start your career.  Amazing opportunities.  Additionally they offer great training to get to get you started.  Managers are great.
ConsNone
Great company that cares about its interns. As an intern, you get exposed to different industries. I was rotated between three different clients in different industries. 
I loved working for KPMG! I started entry level and stayed for 3 years. I left because I felt that I wasn't seen as more then this entry level role and didn't feel I would be able to move to different departments and excel. I did make a lateral move to the NYC office and I REALLY liked the job but just wasn't making enough money.  So I sadly left to get more experience elsewhere. I do wish there was more opportunity to move and be seen even though I had such an entry level support role. 
"ProsNice PTO, nice people and environmentConsFelt ""type casted"" in my role and department"
Work-life balanceI had a good boss. I want to get hired in Charlotte NCOverallIt was a good experience. I worked there three years after I finished college. I worked hard everyday. I wish I could get hired I. Charlotte NC. I am available if they're looking
KPMG is an amazing place to begin your career, extremely supporting company depending on the service, only qualm would be the pay. but you get the chance to work on various projects which definitely aids your growth
It is a great place to learn, but managers does not appreciatte your sacrifices. Poor staff organization and no coordination. Salary is not enough for all the hours you work.  
It is a public accounting firm, so there is inherent dissatisfaction. Beyond that, KPMG was a great place to work. I enjoyed my coworkers and a good majority of management.
At least in my area of expertise and within my team, I felt I had plenty of exposure to a variety of different kinds of work under different managers. I think this is a great thing for entry level workers who may not know exactly what they want to do with their careers. Longer run, in consulting you need to become more specialized to stay in, but for a first job out of college I would recommend KPMG. However, the culture of each team and line of business can vary greatly, which one should also keep in mind.
Almost 15 years with KPMG and with this virus stuff continuing they had to make some hard choices and I was one of them otherwise I would still be working there.
ProsWork life balance
People are great to work with.  Business margin pressures lead to lot of cost cutting and restricting.  Senior management changes every 5 years so changes are always occurring for both good and bad.
ProsPeople and benefitsConsRecent focus on cost cutting
KPMG is proud to be a diverse professional firm.  I worked with some great people and served clients in a number of industries.  Because of some specialized knowledge, I was able to work on special project outside of my region.
ProsGreat clients
It is great place to start your career, but you must remember you can be placed on multiple busy seasons back to back. Once that occurs it's easy  to realize how underpaid the staff is.
I had a really great internship experience at KPMG! The managers were really supportive as well as the associates I worked with in ensuring that I understood the work that I was doing. 
I started off with the firm on an outstanding note for about a year (despite lack of pay for grueling work and exhausting hours and utter disregard for work / life balance).  When I transitioned to a new engagement, I received next to no training for my position.  This set me up for failure immediately, especially as a recent graduate just beginning my career.  I was told repeatedly by colleagues that I did not belong with KPMG because I didn't major in business or accounting. Due to frequent questioning and doubts as to why I'm apart of the firm, I struggled feeling a sense of belonging.  My manager was very unprofessional, who micromanaged and forwarded me emails containing catty, negative discussions between other colleagues about me. The directors and managers were only concerned about promoting themselves rather than genuinely caring about employees and the client.  Toxic environment and toxic, fake people. If you don't possess a Type A personality or superiority complex or (god forbid) didn't study business or accounting, run far away.  Many individuals have had great experiences with KPMG and I wish I had the same opportunity.  Proud to say I am no longer with the firm and now very happy in my new work with a fantastic company.
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
Great place to work with an office hoteling concept. The firm is very responsive to the employees work/life needs and the salary is great. I highly recommend KPMG as one of the best places I have worked.
ProsVery Flexible work schedulesConsIT Processes have to be modernized. They should hire more permanent employees instead of contractor.
This job stressed me. I worked very long hours and with little recognition for it. It’s great that they pay for meals and transportation but they work you very hard for not as nearly the same amount in pay.
ProsStable jobConsToo long off hours
great company with amazing benefits...i wish i never lost the job smh. i reall missed working there. ppl are nice and they have the best HR who protect their employees.
You are expected to put in 50-60 hours per week, including weekends. You expect to have to put in extra time on occasion to deal with a schedule issue or an emergency. They do not add staff when there is too much work, they expect you to take the time out of your personal life to fill in the gaps.The compensation and benefits are adequate, assuming a normal work/life balance. Considering the amount they work you, it falls far short.The IT department has no room for advancement, especially after they outsourced several hundred positions to India and Mexico this summer.The best thing that can be said about KPMG is that they encourage a strong ethical culture. You feel safe in speaking up about issues.
- KPMG does Agile development which works great for their team dynamic.- Everyone works as a team and will often rotate between projects so that no one person is on a project 100% of the time.- Everyone is eager to help- This was the first time I actually felt like a real Software Developer and my work actually mattered
ProsExcellent team dynamic, Great office, good work life balance, good pay, great benefits
It's just like they tell you.Interesting work, but long hours. Great people, but a few bad apples can make your life miserable. They do take good care of you financially and with awesome benefits, but you will be working hard for them.
ProsInteresting enough, Great benefitsConsHours can be brutal
I wish I could have continued to work with kpmg. I have got good exposure till the time I work with. Good place to work. I feel Kpmg cares employees like a baby.
Nothing was good, absolutely hated this company. Too much work, seniors who were cut throat and would literally curse at you, favoritism, lack of diversity, too many Type A personalities. Run!!!
OverallGreat company to work. I enjoyed everyday working here. Great management and the team culture is excellent. Flexible work schedule and great work life balance
Good benefitsNice peopleAbility to work seamlessly in remote environment and still feel connected, part of the culture. Opportunity to drive organized processes that interlink the different functions better; some silos put us at a disadvantage. 
ProsNice people, strong culture
A great place to work. Colleagues are bright. Managers are held to a high bar for values. I would recommend. They are people-focused and care about employees.
ProsGreat co-workersConsSome delay in addressing low performance
I learned a lot of relevant information however it came at the cost of long hours during busy season (i.e., 70+ hours) and continuous stress. Seems to be a place where you fall in line rather than be yourself. 
ProsDecent pay, fast growth.ConsPoor work/life balance, over worked
This place will make you feel like your career is at the forefront for learning and growing which is great. The only sacrifice is that you have no work-personal life balance.
I have no complaints over starting my career at KPMG. I lasted three years until a senior auditor and left to pursue internal audit knowing the skills I took with me would be valuable. 
ProsPeople, experience, perksConsLong hours, high stress
Great culture and environment.  People are very kind on all levels up to management. Long hours and heavy deadlines but communications is great during this time and multiple opportunities.

Busy season lasted about 6/7 months as I was tossed from one busy season client to the next. The most hours I worked in a week was 80 hours, which was awful. Managers expect you to put work first without saying it out right. Pay and bonuses are less than I thought they would be. 
- Good PTO plan- Good office shutdown at year-end- Good staff to work with- Hard to take a vacation during the busy season- A lot of financial restriction and compliance on manager level above- A lot of tedious administrative stuff 
ProsSee aboveConsSee above
Plan on performing repetitive tasks ad nauseam for years on  end.  Incompetent management only out to save themselves.  Many co-workers are not trustworthy.  Not a good place to work unless you hate life.
ProsAbove average PTOConspoor raises and bonuses, no promotions, rampant favortism
KPMG is a great place to start your career. It’s a huge resume builder and every day is different. There are many opportunities to learn and grow. Unfortunately there’s no work life balance and you may have to juggle multiple clients at once. There are also so many new required work papers within the last year but you don’t get any more time allocated to complete these. Jobs can be very understaffed as well.
ProsGreat office and benefitsConsNo work life balance and stressful environment
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
Kpmg is a great place to start a career and advance quickly. The skills you develop are useful in any future role.  The environment is fast paced and client service driven.
The culture and ambient are great at KPMG, the workload is heavy but you get support from your peers. If you work as a project manager there will be tremendous amount of overtime and pressure to deliver; on the positive side, if you are an employee you get paid furlough  twice a year, last week and first week in January and two weeks in July.
ProsFree bananas and candyConsheavy workload
The people that you work with on a project will make or break your experience at the firm. The firm keeps cutting down employee benefits during difficult times, but never increase them back afterwards. Job security is pretty good though.
This was the second time in the past several years that they have laid off employees due to outsourcing to India  and Mexico.  The job growth isn't at par with other companies.
The work environment is full of opportunities in various Accounting fields.Lots of trainings are provided for employees.It a safe working environment.
You have feeling work-life balance. Great environment with well skilled work team. Good salary, and compensation. People work at KPMG for yrs and even retire.
ProsKnowlegde people to work with
If you value your career, and understand your career is short and experience is valuable, don’t waste the years where you could and should be working with competent management
ProsSome really talented but broken peopleConsLeadership being arrested for felonious conduct (google it)
Overall, I enjoyed my time at KPMG. However, this was mainly because of the greatest coworkers and perks given. It truly felt like family. KPMG had many loyal coworkers who were passionate, optimistic, and inclusive. KPMG allows a great employee experience. Benefits and perks are ideal. The one downside to KPMG was the lack of management. Some PMLs need more mandatory, formal trainings. They are not flexible as far as work life balance, there is evident micro-managing, and many employees will attest that it is challenging to get promoted even when demonstrating results and excellent performance. It's discouraging especially for the younger employees and associates who came in at an already low salary and are eager to learn more and grow. If things don't change, the new or younger employees will not remain loyal. If management and leadership really focus on career development and flexibility, KPMG would be perfect. Hoping to return to KPMG one day with more experience and help make an impact!
ProsGenerous benefits and perks like PTO and campus events, friendly culture, positive environmentConsPoor management, difficult to get promoted

ProsGood exposure to finance worldConsWork life balance
The people who work at KPMG are great to work for and with, the work itself is typical audit work for large clients. You learn a lot but are underpaid and overworked.
A very friendly staff with a great environment, a place like you want to say I’m home, very good schedule and pay. A great place to work for ever. Good people with always smile to help you whenever you need
My team at KPMG were total pros - colleagues who combined mastery of their subject matter with high social intelligence and collegiality.  I was pushed hard at KPMG but never overtly.  Rather, the incentive to strive was to keep up with the hard working and very intelligent colleagues and contribute to team success.
You must love what you do otherwise you will burn out quickly.  Busy season can be very stressful and often times personalities clash due to high demands and low guidance/direction from management.
Overall, I had a good time working with KPMG. The culture is amazing, the employee and manager collaboration and support is very strong. There is definitely favoritism played toward Audit/Tax/Advisory
"Great company to work for many reasons. You get the experience of working in various business environments. The a manager assigns you to various audits. You report to a supervisor, who in tern reports to a manager. The manager reports to the audit partner.  You have many options in many fields. You may select audit, tax or specialized consulting."
Good work place, good pay/benefits, Quality free lunch/dinner, Hyatt benefits, 12 complementary nights, excellent work environment, in door 98% of the time
Great place to start off your career. The experience you will get is unmatched however the hours are not ideal at all. You will work 50-60 hours weeks On your salary and you will work a lot of weekends as well. The work life balance is their biggest pitfall other than that it is a great place to work.
Learned the organization and my manager did not live the principals they claim and espouse.  Culture shock had previously worked for a highly principled organization that walked the talk.  Not the case at KPMGwalked
ProsDecent compConsEthical issues amongst leadership, arrests of leadership
Culture is driven by the practice leaders - the environment is set by the partner, which can be a good or bad thing. Good place to start your career, but a small but noticeable step down from the Big 4 leaders.
"Pros:- A ton of on-the-job learning- Experience in various industries- Benefits & CultureCons:- Work/life balance- Stress (during busy season)"
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
工作量大，晚上十点下班是正常的，偶尔通宵。但是能在3年左右对财务方面有非常大的长进. 正常积极地展现自己
"All good except the workload  Decent trainingSharp coworkersSupportive partners  Work life balance sucks especially in busy seasons  WFH/flexibility is great"
This is a great place to work. The people are closely connected and inclusive, the schedules are flexible and the compensation is competitive as well. Overall a good job to have.
ProsFree lunches during busy seasons, flexible work locations and schedulesConsVery busy October through February, long hours
Big four was not for me. I did not like the culture or the on boarding process. I felt like I was handed a computer and told to go audit a multi billion dollar public company with no guidance.
I very much enjoyed working at KPMG, Although I was only a contractor.  The work environment was wonderful with great management.  Wish I could have stayed longer, however COVID had other plans.
"Experienced hires have a difficult melding into the cultureMet and worked with enjoyable staffAffinity groups were promotedCommunity responsiveness promoted"
A quality environment with great support network. Great culture, with super communication and information sharing. Very enjoyable environment with great management
"Overall KPMG is great place to work.Typical day - (9:00- 5;30 pm)Management is great, a lot of learning opportunities, multi cultural environment, a lot of offshore development."
Great Place to get public accounting experience. You end up learning a lot over the years because exposure you get with different clients and people you get to work with.
Poor leadership, What you to enforce standards and policy, but will not back you.  Contractor treated very badly and let you know your place with threats.
"Cons:Limited strategic investments through acquisitions. Trying to grow organically but has failed in past 3-5 years. No clear vision on what the next 5 years look like for the organizationPlaying between converting into a tech firm or being an impartial adviser to its clients.No clear career path based on merit. Old boys club, you go up based on who you know. Managers and directors do all the work, partners make all the money. Started to hire consultants right out of college.Ad hoc hiring and roles - someone with 3-5 years of work exp will come in at associate level, same as someone out of collegePay is below market compared to other big 4Bonus is not visible in paycheck. Pros:Decent place to start a career and learn the basics. Leave after 2-3 years."
"12 hour days poor management team learned a lot about diligence hardest part was the hours and the volume of work diligence memos, phone calls with clients and excel allllll day"
Great Managers and great team whom inspire, encourage you to be your best as well as reward those that do an exceptional job! great PTO time too and holiday vacation time as the firm shuts down so you have time off to spend with family -- they encourage it. Respect, integrity, diversity, fair, rewarding - best place to work hands down.
"This was a very interesting company to work for with lots of exciting projects.  But my area did not have a lot of work to do at times, in other areas there was quite a large amount of work to do, but not all were trained or allowed to do these things.  Found management to be aloof and    there was a limit to group bonding, you were basically on your own all the time almost.  Directions were given too many times verbally and through non-written non-official documents and ways, this made things very confusing and difficult.  On balance was a ""good place to work"" just had many challenges to get past."
one of the strongest pillars most organizations rely upon, their existence is unshakable and their quality of services is one of the best. I will like to recommend it to any company that wants the best audit.
The job was a great experience for me. It build up on my skills in joining together to help the community with providing them with things they need. it also had help me become more professional at a work place.
The manager is so helpful in each task assigned to the team. My manager is very systematic and disciplined. I learned a lot working under her guidance.
Management was unfair and racist. The company has great perks but if they don’t like you, it’s impossible to move up or change departments. If I had more support I would of never left the company.
"Pushed out of organization when spouse became sick with cancer. No understanding of personal tragedy, just ""your performance is slipping"" get the work done faster."
I can say this was a good job for me I mainly had it because of the fact that I was required to work one day out of the week at a company and they placed me here for a 2 years and I honestly liked it.
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
I got the job offer after my internship back to the time i was still in school. This is my first job out of college. I am still proud of myself to make to Big4. If you are student and looking for review for one of a Big4, remember that if you choose Big4, you have to know in mind that working long hours, 2-3 busy seasons/ year are just normal thing. You will learn as you go. Now, I realize that many companies are looking to hire people from Big4 or they all came from Big4.
Decent place to work. Great people that will help you throughout your career. You advance quickly if you're a high performer. Work-life balance is a fairytale.
"Work environment is good but there is no vision/roadmap for top management.A very good work life balanceGood BenefitsThe group i work with has no planning/roadmap, the management just wanted to do the job done"
Challenging and rewarding place to work. Surrounding by extremely intelligent people with strong work ethic. Great place to start a career. Learned something new each and every day.
"amazing and nice place to work.has supportive managers and employees that all work as a team to provide the client with the best service. They also hire from within."
Generally a good company but the management team I reported into was flaky and I couldn't trust them. I was a contractor there and one evening they called my recruiter and cancelled my contract with out a direct word to me.
KPMG has a rich history and a system that is comprised of carefully placed values that will develop employees as a professional. Many people can't stand the pressure. They blame the pressure on people, work, and system. Nevertheless, if you learn to work with the pressure and allocate those pressures into personal development of character, you will find yourself appreciated in the work place.
I don’t doubt that experience for consultants isn’t bad, but the back office BPG jobs here are god awful - think admin/ resource management, EMC, marketing, HR, recruiting, etc.  middle managers skate by doing nothing.  Raises are non existent.
ProsLittle pressureConsEverything else
KPMG is a very competitive and demanding environment to work in. Every day there are a plethora of both internal and external (client) challenges that much be managed.
ProsGreat culture, smart peopleConsThere is never a feeling of accomplishment. Even if your client delivery activities are complete, the expectation is that you will always spend time on business development and internal initiatives.
Can not trust Partners - in it for themselves......You work at the will of the Partnership, and for nothing else but big paychecks - fine to start but really painful 2 months into it.
"+ Nice people+ Flexible hours+ Work from home if needed+ or - Stress-free, but boring slow-paced working environment- No culture- Blind management- Consultants are 2nd class citizens and expendables"
Great place, great team, great examples to learn from. my entire experience has been great with f=great quality work and being given a chance to make an impact in such a huge organization
Employees are viewed as a resource, are genuinely valued by Partners and Directors. Exceptionalism is oftentimes rewarded. I learned to work with tight deadlines and to deal work under pressure.
ProsWork environment
Pleasant physical environment with very little interaction with management. The job itself is very predictable, routine with no variety- borderline robotic. The hardest part of the job is sitting in a seat all day long, with no option to telecommute and no interaction with other people.
ProsUnconventional approach to time off/firm closureConsStale, bland, very militant/old school management style
If you can look beyond the bi-annual fear of having your role outsourced, the constant cost cutting measures, and the lack of raises and promotions this could be a phenomenal place to work.
A copmpany you can be proud to work for. Whereas the company is made up of several different areas and teams, the majority invests in their people and encourages them to learn and grow.
#4 of the BIG4 for a reason. Ridiculous hours and very little feedback on how to improve quality of work. Upper management is non-existent, unsure how they were ever promoted to their positions in the first place.

good place to work with the oppourtunity tot meet a lot of new people, very interesting with different things happening week on week and an over all very happy staff
There are so many roles at KPMG, that you become very specialized. It's easy to become complacent and stop learning new skills. The work-life balance can be good, and the PTO is nice.
Can’t complain about my 9 years at KPMG but wish I’d gotten out sooner. Good pay, pleasant colleagues but pretty repetitive work if you’re in admin.The management works to with employee to support their work.Honestly the hardest part of the job for me was the work getting boring. 
Really great people to work with, emphasis is on end product, stressful for anyone who has kids or a family.  Best for those who don't mind travel and/or long hours.
Great place to work, super smart people. Loved working there, super flexible and open minded management. Company invest in their employees and so many opportunities to learn and move around.
ProsLong hours
Working at KPMG is a great place to establish yourself in the financial world and will open the doors to many future opportunities. Unfortunately, these benefits and opportunities come at a high cost of time and resources. Big 4 accounting companies ask a lot of lower-level employees and do not compensate them accordingly. If you can sacrifice many aspect of your life to put in the time at a big 4 accounting firm, it will pay dividends in the future, but is not preferable when actually involved with the company.
"KPMG is a innovative company if you like to learn and grow.The hours are flexible and the firm is very employee friendlyThey provide quality time off for their employees as well."
KPMG thrives on young talent, there is no doubt. However, it becomes clear how much they take advantage of their employees (only after people start dropping like flies). Pay is also ~25% below market value -- you can do better.
An opportunity to work in one of the big 4s can help set a great foundation for one's career. there is also available supportive working system to help you focus and result-driven.
KPMG is a very good.place to start your career. Everyday is an opportunity to learn something- both soft skills and technical knowledge. You are given lots of responsibilities even after just 2 years at the firm. You have the privilege of exploring several companies .You have the opportunity to meet CEOs, MDs, CFOs you probably only hear of in the news. It coul be stressful but its worth it.
"1.  Loved the job and people I supported.2. Kpmg is seriously committed to underprivileged communities and charitable works/donations.3. Plenty of opportunities for tuition, pro bono and participating in charitable events.I can only speak to my tenure.  The EA management style bordered on abuse."
Same as the rest of Big 4.  You work a lot and learn a lot and then decide how long you want to stay in public accounting.  I don't think they are ahead or behind any of the other firms.  Individual experiences will vary more due to clients/location than differences within the firms themselves.
The company overall is pleasant to work for. The exception is in the Tax practice, here the focus is on a few who will be rewarded and the rest are just working stiffs, to be used and disposed off in 2 cycles.
It has been an amazing journey at KPMG for last 4 years..Our team is awesome and so are our business partners. It is an amazing journey so far. I have learnt a lot and have contributed as much.
Fast pace job with good coworkers who are passionate about what they do. The work is project base and travel is a regular occurance. Except to travel to client site most weeks.
KPMG lakehouse is a one of a kind place. They are not stingy with the pay. They treated me like family and they have high expectations. KPMG wants the best of the best and pays housekeepers 15dollars an hour   lobby attendant pays 18, banquets 20, bartenders 24. I am grateful for the experience
"This KPMG office in Silicon Valley has a first year associate turn over rate of over 50% within the first year. That means 50% of the first-year employees quit before their year is up. Recruitment for this company is a scam. They lure you in with the promise of internal growth and job stability. However, all you receive as a first year is torturous hours, minimal compensation (when you finally do the math), and little to no guidance or support. The recruiters deserve Oscars. They are great at their job. They paint a picture of elitism and success. They convince college students into believing they will be entering the business and accounting world on top. They tell you that you will be working a couple hours later than usual during a busy season that lasts 1-2 months. The reality is that these students are crushed into accepting a sub-par lifestyle that devalues them as human beings. Any free-spirit they have going into this job is obliterated. In order to continue working here, one must accept an ideology in which their time means nothing. I have and will continue to warn individuals exploring employment at this office. I will tell them the truth. The ""busy season"" that lasts ""1-2 months"" is a lie. You can get assigned to a second, maybe even a third. The ""extra couple hours"" is also a lie. Try leaving at 11PM after working through lunch and dinner and not being provided a single break. The management bears no responsibility. The environment is not one of support and guidance. Rather there is resentment and irritation at a beginner's inability to perform a task they were never - more..."
Just as they advertise - great place to start your career. You work very, very hard but work with very talented people. Learned a lot and made some great friends.
They work you to death day and night - work life balance is an issue.  Management is awful and doesn’t listen to your requests sir time off.  Time off is not really time off your still working.
Nice place to work.  You learn a lot, there is a lot of opportunity to work with different teams, management is generally supportive, great benefits t
ProsGreat Benefits
Company often values profits over people when it comes time for bonuses/raised; often only leadership is rewarded for their efforts.  The hardest part of the job is often getting the work required done with the resources provided.
Management style is supportive and does not micromanage. Each employee works independently supported by a collaborative work environment. Flexible work hours accommodates other life priorities.
ProsFlexible Hours, Free Starbucks CoffeeConsDoes not offer Paid Time Off
Peers are great people.  Friendly, informative.  I have had terrific Managers.  Location is good.  Allowed to work remote.  Improved skills with training and working with other staff.

"-Excellent culture-Benefits and PTO are outstanding-Solid place as a base platform for a young person's career-Co-workers are genuinely bright and great to learn from-Great client exposure"
"I would not recommend Big 4 to anyone of color, particularly African-american.  Not a safe space for career preservation, vertical-mobility, nor healthy relationships.  Lack of mentors, isolationism, ""survival-of-the-fittest....dog-eat-dog"" predominates the culture.  Constant need to prove one's worthiness and work regularly monitored (timed/gauged).   Volunteerism and/or community footprint opportunities are plentiful, meaningful, and rewarding."
I think KPMG is a great company for a multitude of reasons, but management could be better, and the promotion process more equitable. I've enjoyed my time at the company, but the pay could also be better. Great culture, and competent staff.
"-Excellent culture-Benefits and PTO are outstanding-Solid place as a base platform for a young person's career-Co-workers are genuinely bright and great to learn from-Great client exposure"
The title sums up how I feel about my time at KPMG. You will learn a lot due to the long hours and exposure to diverse clients. However, you will consistently feel underappreciated due to the business model. This is especially eye-opening once you move on to your next job/career.
It was a pretty normal job. I did everything that was asked of me and the workload was not too bad. Most of the time I was driving from workplace to workplace.
I only did a short contract but working there was nice, you don't get any benefits as a contractor and no job security but besides that it was good working at KPMG.
My boss was absolutely amazing. He was very knowledgeable and carried the team efficiently. I would have thorough meetings with the business to gather requirements.
I started at KPMG as a contractor and learned a lot over the 3 years with the company. I am grateful for the opportunities and my experiences,  which has prepared me for future opportunities.
Great place to work with many opportunities for growth and incredible culture  but work life balance, politics, and endless administrative burdens make things challenging
Great management and overall place to work. Big 4 public accounting is very time consuming at times but that is due to the nature of the work and the staff in utilization model.
It requires a lot of traveling to client sites usually, do not expect to spend much time in your city. the per diem is always fair and you learn a lot on the Job.
I worked at KPMG for nine years and it is like any other big company I imagine.  Politics and red tape, but everyone's heart is in the right place.  So overall good experience.
"I spent years working in the IT dept at KPMG, and then the bean counters decided to save a few pennies and outsourced IT to IBM. I returned to KPMG in an associate director role and left the company to persue another opportunity."
Good Place to Learn and Grow for someone right out of school or someone who is looking to learn the consulting profession and take their career to the next level
KPMG Global Audit is a very challenging and rewarding environment. The goals and expectations are high, yet achievable, and provide a feeling of meaningful contribution, which is appropriately acknowledged by management.
You have to be able to sell the company's products for management to like you. So much pressure to bring business to the company. Doesn't matter how quantitative you are.
May be busy, but allows you to travel and attain very applicable skills. Days are typically fast-paced and exciting. The work is constantly changing, both within an engagement and as you switch between engagements.
"A typical day as a senior analyst is related to performing audit procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on management assertions on the various financial statement balances. In addition to those, I also worked on statutory audits and advisory services under both of PRC GAAP and IFRS, follow up with internal/external department ensure financial documentation prepared/completed is accurate and properly is crucial as well.  I believe this work ethic and experience at KPMG would lay a solid foundation for becoming a business professional in the future."

"The interview process was fast and fair. Unfortunately, the rest of the process took longer than I liked because it took more than 3 months to get the team on-site and we were not getting paid. Once, our time was on site everything was going smooth again. we were trained in bankruptcy testing along with how to use the software that was given to us.  From there we worked 10-hour shift Monday - Thursday and got paid every week and the work wasn't hard but just very tedious."

Good company to work for as a contractor, not sure how is the experience for the permanent employees. Work culture is great and lot of helpful people around you who want you to succeed and be part of the family.
Not the most ideal place to grow professionally. A lot of politics involved when it comes to round table for promotion and salary increase. You get penalized for seeking to grow and try new field within the firm.
Great work, great experience and clients.  Managers are often detatched: sometimes too lazy or too distracted to care about anything but the client's satisfaction.
The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to work with high caliber individuals each and everyday. The level of expertise and precision was second to none.
Un cabinet ou la charge de travail est trés importante.

The job barely gave you time to be with your family. Management wasn't understanding. Worked late hours and didn't feel appreciated. Not the best place.
productive and fun workplace with a lot of fun and respectful workmates.a place where  you can work and be productive also a place where you can learn new things every single day
They are becoming efficient as work can be done remotely. Tech support is also 24/7.  The managers and staff are very supportive.  The hardest part is my travel to Albany from New York City.
"I manage various projects and take care of day to day operations with property management.I try and learn something new everyday to keep up with the times and changes.The most enjoyment in my job is to get projects completed in a timely manner and is done correctly."
Not a fan. I was treated poorly by the administrative staff of the partners, worked with caddy people in DC, Norfolk, Richmond and Philadelphia offices. The “team” I was on were made up of unkind, mean, belittling staff. Horrible experience.
Great company to work for. Dynamic and professional environment. Interesting work. Plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Long hours, especially during a busy season.
My devOPs carrier started with KPMG, I started as system administrator and later was given opportunity to continue my study, after months I was promoted to devOPs Engineer
Good company to work for. The company has alot to offer. I have learned alot since joining in 2007. The department I'm in has given room to really grow.
"Great place to work. Very ""state of the art"", work-life balance, working from home are some of the many great benefits. Summer gifts and summer out, leaving early every Friday during summer. Good place for advancement."
I thoroughly enjoy the company culture at KPMG. The managers are extremely intelligent and are more-than willing to put down their work for 20 minutes to help teach/explain a concept. The busy season prepares you to solidify concepts and conceptually grasp what an audit truly means. I have learned an incredible amount while working here.
KPMG has a great company culture. They work incredibly hard to make new employees feel like the work you has meaning. They pay very well, but the work can become a drag.

"Virtually impossible to obtain CPA, typical day is over 10 hours and culture is very old school in terms of staying later than your boss even if you have finished your work.  Very high stress, sink or swim."
As expected by its reputation as one of the Big4. The smallest and probably the most laid back of the 4. The people there are sophisticated yet caring.
lot of short term projects so ability to build your resume fairly quickly.  highly recommend for ppl 1-6 yrs into their career, or for people later who need to build it.  experience will vary by practice.
Good for your career advancement early on in your career, but try to leave after 3 years if you can make it that long for your resume  Extremely demoralizing, horrible management. Negativity is rampant in this office, they will put you down no matter how much work you put in. They will put as much work on you as possible, without thanking you or compensating you accordingly. Good learning experience. Just be forewarned of the office politics, keep to yourself, and hack it as long as you can, then leave for a company that respects and compensates you
Trabaje durante 13 años en KPMG y puedo afirmar que se consiguen amigos más que compañeros de trabajo y representa escuela de desarrollo profesional dónde todos están dispuestos a compartir sus experiencias.
ConsEl salario pudo ser mejor
They’re pretty open to just scheduling you whenever you’re available, you pretty much just set up your own availability and they’ll schedule you accordingly. Just be prepared to work a full 8 hours.
Great place to work. Fantastic diverse colleagues. Excellent training environment. There’s always something new to learn each day. There’s room for improvement.
My roles is very challenging, it's different from day to day which keeps it interesting.  The workplace is great and the networking is awesome.  The hardest part of the job is working with so many personalities and trying to please all, it's just not possible.
I wasted a year here with my boss encouraging people to not work with me. Selling air and lots of politics.  It was an experiment that those of us working the plan didn’t know. People fight over their share of commissions and guard their territory and customers with a deadly force. Depressing offering help to people that don’t want it.
One of the best best best work life experience. I didn't like that the pay was not market competitive but one of the best work life balance and company culture.
The office I was in has really taken a bad turn over the last 2 years. About a quarter of the group I was in quit since the summer, and more are planning to. One of KPMG's core values is open and honest communication, but they don't give honest communication regarding feedback or promotions. After getting fed up with inconsistent feedback I looked into other firms. Ended up at another firm, making a lot more money, and feeling like I am appreciated. Every aspect of the other firm has been better - disappointed that I waited to make the jump.
Entorno agresivo y competitivo, foco en rentabilidad y nada en los equipos
"KPMG is a great place to work with many dedicated professionals and a family like culture built upon shared success and engagement. Regardless of level / title every individual or team was approachable and supportive"
Typical day was 8-10 hrs. in the office with occasional calls in the evenings or early morning before normal work hours.  People were polite with most business conducted over Skype or conference calls.  As a Partnership the business model is very consensus oriented for decision making which presented a challenge at times to arrive at consensus timely.
The experience you gain is very invaluable. I have learned to work under-pressure and have fun at the same time.  The work environment is very conducive for better productivity. We were even provided with a lounge and a TV for hosting clients and for relaxing.

Great career for those looking to stay behind a desk and review paperwork. Simply wasn't the position for me, but plenty of opportunities to grow. No overtime and very long hours required.
I really enjoyed working at KPMG LLP. They offered woking remotely, insurance, paid time off and bonus. People in management are very professional and worth respect. They treat employees with respect.
Una empresa donde se trabaja con sentido de urgencia,
The KPMG corporate work environment is not ideal for applicants seeking work life balance, time required for new families. and/or parents with small children.
The workplace culture is that of work hard and play hard. Everyone is incredibly self-driven and strives to be the best in the field. The culture from the top-down is great and benefits everyone involved.
Leadership style out of manger and leadership based in New Jersey was hostile and toxic. People would send negative feedback to your manger behind your back just for sport.
"The Strategy Advisory at KPMG has many talented individuals and a great reputation in the marketplace.  Yet, it seems as if the firm is undergoing constant turmoil. Re-organizations and strategic shifts are constant but they never achieve anything from a practical standpoint besides confusing the professionals.  These always involve lots of complicated but meaningless frameworks, several hours of senior executives speaking jibberish and a shiny new object to distract from the underperformance/failure of the last big initiative.The firm also seems to jump from scandal to scandal, which results in lots of new policies aimed at the professional staff, required trainings & compliance certifications and an endless torrent of e-mails.Both of these ""tendencies"" ignore the real problem - poor management with no accountability.  Until KPMG realizes and addresses this in a meaningful way, both work satisfaction and financial results will continue to decline."
Work/life balance can be lopsided but that's the nature of consulting industry. KPMG's workplace culture is welcoming and you can bring your authentic self to work.
"Great place to learn skills fast.  It's a very sink-or-swim environment and some managers make great lifeguards that will help you learn and succeed...some do not.  You will work long hours and will probably have to work weekends as well depending on the time of year.  If this is the career field you want to be in and you're willing to make those sacrifices, it's a great company.If you're unsure, think about looking at industry options instead."
Excellent for working parents; work-life balance. Very different cultural experience for client-facing professionals, vs. support teams. The Communications dept. has been unstable for years; lack of leadership and consistency toward the firm strategy.
Old school managers who never left and have no idea how things operate outside of their workspace. Treat people poorly and the technology division is horrible.
Multiple complaints and company did nothing to resolve the main issue. Most of the employees are nice to work with. A few didn’t know what they are doing or wasted company time
KPMG is driven by its mission, customer centricity, and value creation services.  KPMG’s core values of Respect, Teamwork and Collaboration, Open and Honest Communications, and Acting with Integrity are the pillars over which the organization’s success is built. This is a great company to work for.
You will learn a lot and have plenty of opportunity to make a difference. Workplace culture is what you make of it. You will handle a lot of client confedential information.
Overall, a good place to learn the ins and outs of IT Audit (or any other branch). That being said, the work/life balance is very hard to find unless you advocate for yourself and communicate with your team.
I was at KPMG for a number of years. It was a good starting point but ultimately not somewhere I wanted to stay. There was a lot of opportunities to move around the company which I took and that gave me a well rounded experience.
I feel like KPMG is a great company. However, I think in my current position there is an expectation that you work regardless of whether you should be working at that time. I feel like I cannot truly disconnect and recharge. Then when I do return there is almost a guilt trip feeling for taking my time off. I don’t feel like it promotes a good working culture.

KPMG offers a work-life balance. Process and metrics heavy are detrimental to the Agile process. Mix experience with work culture, get cooperation from colleagues and team members. Management is becoming process heavy and business value is getting sideline.
the environment is not conducive to personal and professional growth though the company likes to think so  it’s a very stressful environment and people are more competitive than collaborative
