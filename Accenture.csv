Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Very fast paced with high expectations. Salary might be under market in some organizations. Comprehensive benefits package and some corporate discounts. 
The assignment one is working at (the client) has a lot to do with the stress level of the job.  Some assignments have very challenging client management involved with unrealistic expectations.  That said, every Accenture resource I interacted with was positive... people were helpful, appreciative, and were smart.  BUT everyone was so busy the availability to help others was limited given the very heavy workloads.  
ProsVery smart people, challenging work... always learning. Great pay and benefitsConsWork-life balance. Some luck of the draw on client assignment.
Accenture itself is an amazing company but they are far from knowledge about to guide the agents to become part of a group. No clear career path and your background doesn't matter. 
Very good atmosphere , cares for the employees wellbeing, had good bus service when i was working in india. Increments are less. Everying depends on manager and project
Lots of opportunity to learn and develop. Management truly cares about people. You get to work with some of the world’s most intelligent people who are willing to teach
Depending on the project it can me a great place to learn about new technologies. Good work life balance. Benefits and pay raise are a bit of a draw back.
Enjoyed my time with Accenture! Good benefits. Friendly environment, supportive management .Life work balanceReally Nice place to work.Diversity …….. love it
Accenture is definitely one of the best jobs I’ve had. They have great benefits for their employees. They are very understanding. I worked for TMHP.  
Good place to work, lots of opportunity to move up. Responsibility to further your career is up to you and you must look internally yourself for opportunities 
I have been with Accenture for over 8 years and really enjoyed the project work and working with some of the smartest people in the world.Great flexibility and sincere team members.Traveling can get to you at some point.
ProsGreat co-workers, Interesting Projects, FlexibleConsTravel, Not lot of wiggle room for promotion
There is room for growth for everyone. They ev3n partner with other organizations that offer courses to help its employees to grow.Accenture has alot to offer especially  if one is curious and interested in advancing.whatever one needs from family to educational there is always help.someone is ready to guide n direct on what steps to take or how to go about.its great when you know you have a family to count on.thats a place one will love to go to everyday for work cus it's not just for the job,it's a family
ProsFree to talk with wellness coaches, team leads at any time
I started with Accenture in July 2021, I absolutely love everything about the company, free food, free snacks, lots of chairs, couches, areas to lounge and work from, lots of perks, great work environment. I was sad to be redeployed, and it can happen to anyone. My team was only given a weeks notice of the project ending, and it was over the holidays. I still have not received anything from HR about what to do next. 
Loved the pay and The benefits and mentorship on the company is not good. Managers say they do not have time for you but mainly sit on their time.  Their expectations are high but they do absolutely nothing to help . 
ProsGreat benefitsConsManagers
Hardest part was that your job security was entirely dependent on your ability to get onto another project after you're done with your current project .
Accenture as a company is great but the current role I have could be better. I started during COVID and while everyone got the privilege to work remotely, I still had to commute daily to an empty office and work the reception/customer service desk. 
Love to work , the place is comfortable . The leads and OMs are friendly and understanding. They know how to handle different agents. They will give you security 
What is the best part of working at the company?Decent pay and benefits What is the most stressful part about working at the company?It’s a huge mess internally. You are your own support system and no one else really cares that much about you, no matter what the company markets to everyone. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?High pressure on selling new lines of work vs. just making clients happy. Managers pushing hourly employees to ghost hours and do extra work that isn’t billable to the employee. Everything is quantity over quality here. They grow and grow, and then they lay off a large segment every few years without any warning and no recourse.
Me encanta trabajar en accenture, buena paga, home office, extension de paternidad. Tienen aguinaldo, fondo de ahorro, utilidades y bonis de despensa, vacaciones 
Avoid Accenture if you want work-life balance, a healthy work environment, career progression based on your experience, skillset, dedication and loyalty. I have been here seven years and worked across various teams. I have never worked for a more disorganized and schizophrenic organization that overlooks and overworks top tier talent while promoting mediocrity. Not sure how Accenture gets so many awards for Top Workplace or Diversity because it certainly does not live up to these values or aspirations once inside the company. The “truly human” HR slogan is a farce. People who have dedicated their entire career and sacrificed their personal lives for this company are overworked and depleted and then treated like a pariah when they burn out or ask for help. True leadership is aging out or leaving for better opportunities, pay and appreciation. Steer clear unless your goal is to be mediocre.  
Excellent large firm to start one's career.  Decent support from mid-level management but overall the firm is getting way too big to define and maintain a consistent company identity and culture.  Work/life balance and quality of interaction with colleagues varies greatly from group to group.
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
First BPO job and company, in the middle of pandemic. I'd say they provided my needs well. Assigned to good and quite stressful account, but with nice colleagues and leads. Salary is fine, but not really enough for my needs and responsibilities. Overall, it's still the best work experience for me.
Team leads weren't interested in their teams. They rarely answered emails or chats. The play favorites. They are not depenedable. When team was laid off, they never provided promised referral letters.
ProsFree lunchConsEverything else
I enjoyed working at Accenture. Team is extremely smart and motivated. They are doing very aggressive projects and trying to modernize government operations.   Lots of processes to follow for all parts of the business.   easy to get lost as a new comer.   Recommend seeking out mentors to show you the ropes and help you find out what's going on and how to get involved.
People here were kind and intelligent. The workload was not as much as I expected to be, and management was good. There were some projects I struggled, but most of my time here was great.
I enjoyed my work at Accenture it was so fun and encouraging. Loved the diversity the pay could be better tho. It depends on the client you work for. Overall a good place. 
Worked for more than a decade. Learned a lot of my technical and functional knowledge.  Experience is project based so not everything will be thesame.
Great company. If its your first entry level position than I would recommend. However there is not much room for growth. So for seasoned person maybe would not recommend. It can get monotonous and boring if not self motivated.
I was an intern at Accenture early this year and I really enjoyed it. It was a great entry point into the tech industry and all of the people on my project were accommodating. 
It was a good learning experience to be introduced into the mortgage industry. They provided training for the mortgage industry as a whole, and the platform we worked for.
You move around a lot, give no real answers to anything. Supervisors change often, no consistency. Constant change in procedures which wouldn’t be so bad if management laid out expectations 
-Competitive Pay.-Benefits Packages.-Excellent Work/Life Balance.-Access to lot of Courses . -Hard scale up.-Can’t choose your projects.-You could get bored.-Poor feedback comms.
Really good nice culture and work life balance! It can be great place to start for your careerI am still early on my career but enjoy it so far!Cons: nothing
What is the best part of working at the company?You are just a number.  Good luck getting intouch with anyone at HR or IT.Inundated with worthless company jargon, when ur computer is bogged down with firewalls and I can’t intouch with IT.They say u can move around into any department. No, not really.They expect to work till u bleed and don’t think of u as a person with a life, or family.It’s a bunch of purple fluff.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Never feel like I can get it all done. Expected to work around the clock and on weekends.IT issues.  Lack of HR supprtWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?I work remote. There is no culture. Just a bunch of culture emails.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Be online no later than 8Am. Deal with micro managing emails.  Spend most of the day in email communication. Get a few hours of actual recruiting work done.
"There is significant backstabbing and political maneuvering in the consulting world and Accenture is a prime example of this. On my exit interview, a critique of my performance was that i was too focused on tasks and getting things done and that i played ""the game"" incorrectly. That should sum up Accenture ""values"". There are plenty of good people there.. once you wade through the muck."
ProsCompensation, BenefitsConsToxic people, Toxic work environment. YMMV
I think that the hardest part of the job is not having a voice that they actually listen to. Sometime you feel unheard and under appreciated as an employee. Its sad because I enjoy my job. 
ProsTeam workConsNot being appreciated
A good company. Trainings/Bootcamp are being offered to new hires in my case I've experienced a 6 months of training/bootcamp for free like COBOL, JAVA, React JS and Japanese Language.
Great company to work for. Excellent client base. Lots of learning. Great brand value. Compensation at per market. Work life balance sometime little difficult. 
Accenture allows you the opportunity to work on multiple projects at one to time.  Also, allows you to work on internal team projects that affords you the opportunity to connect with senior leadership. 
A very good place to work. Management is understanding and fair.Good PTOs policy. Accenture matches 6% of 401k which I believe is awesome.I believe Accenture is policy driven company instead of human driven. 
ProsBenefitsConsClient based
The company as a whole is good. Some departments have horrible managers that made my employment stressful. I quit 10 months later due to lack of support and the toxic environment in that department. No one was willing to address the elephant in the room.
ProsDiversityConsLack of direction from HR
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Tons of project opportunities and huge pipeline, but everything driven by sales, have to fight to get coaching, and little people development. Lots of cookie cutter projects, lots of long term staff aug/outsourcing roles. Or lots of project roles where projects are just staffed however and run poorly just because they have a huge F500 client who just foots the bill and doesn't care about how things are done as long as the final delivery happens. Politically driven structure. Trial by fire. If you are someone who thrives on being a lone wolf, excited by the opportunity to prove yourself in sales/delivery, then this might be a good place. But if you're really focused on more strategic work, focused on people development, then this is not fulfilling long term.
Worked on BP projects. Great coworkers.  Management was willing to teach as long as you were willing to learn. The office space was well thought out,  with privacy,  wellness. And phone rooms to accommodate employees.
This job is great, cafeteria lunch and breakfast provided and your expected to be professional at all times. If you work hard enough and meet your quotas and go above and beyond, then you will have a good chance to move up the ladder but it can be difficult. Overall very stable worklife with great management, but the pay isn't enough to support a family. Work office are filled with high school grads who didn't attend college or senior people making extra money. Personally I don't think it's a career move to stay here and wait your turn to climb the ladder with little pay increase.
There is a lack of diversity especially in the tech and AI groups and it does not appear like much is being done to change that at the more senior levels. Numbers are padded by hiring more females and under represented groups in junior levels but leadership still remains male dominated. There are a confusing amount of reorgs which leads to a difficult environment to build a network and sense of belonging.

Weak skills within the organization and surprisingly inferior knowledge management compared with other professional services firms where I have worked. I did not receive appropriate support as a new employee.
What is the best part of working at the company?Very poorly managed companyWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lack of communication from the upper management
Outsourcing jobs, sometimes I sat at my desk all day doing nothing. When I first started I was really busy for like the first 2 years, then my work was less and less and I went days without work
I like this company, however, the only thing I don't like is the low compensation for my position/ lack of professional growth in my team. If compensation matched with cost of living, I'd have no reason to leave or look elsewhere at the moment.
Prosflexibility (WFH), great benefits, work-life balanceConslow compensation
100% honest opinion I was hired through accenture.  Accenture is a great company but working with NM human services sucks. Never in my years of working have I ever seen a extreme level of micro management done. So much that it's sickening.  They nit pick about everything and want you to fall in line like a robot. You get 30 minutes for lunch and 2 , 15 minute breaks out of a 8 hour shift . When you take 2 to 3 minutes in between to run to the bathroom they complain. They monitor your calls and time you and if your a minute over a 2 minute hold time They give you a bad score.It's honestly like working in a north Korean call center . I wouldn't recommend 
I have worked in other service companies like Infy, Wipro, HCL. compared to them Accenture was good. They have strong internal processes and higher pay compared to others.
great place to work with really accessible and supportive managers. workplace culture is also really great with employee resource groups and other work get togethers. 
Ok to start your career if you’re coming from a coding bootcamp, college grads apply elsewhere. Low pay and compensation in the software engineering field. Accenture is a huge company with MANY different sectors so it really depends which sector/team you’re on. You may get a decent team with work life balance or a heavily micro managed team with a horrible one. As you get on the bench and get interviewed by other teams there you can’t really say no to whichever teams decides to pick you up despite what you may know about their reputation. Takes about a year before you can request to switch teams as well.Very luck dependent on which team you get. Either way, look to get out after a year since they won’t pay you enough
Interesting place to work, seems pretty progressive in terms of pto and the type of holidays you can have off. Definitely want to be sure you get on a good project 
A favorable environment for career advancement. The manager and other coworkers are extremely supportive. It is an excellent place for a newcomer to learn and expand their knowledge.
working as an account manager at Accenture is challenging which many things to learn every day, the management is doing its job however the team leaders struggling to be there for the account manager, they many times do not wish to assist and i can see that they are not happy. 
I enjoyed working here on contract. There are good and bad aspects to be expected at a large firm. Very sharp BAs but can do better to be engaged at the management level.
I worked there for a full year, learned a lot and saw many people with great competences being mistreated because, the team leaders have developped a very toxic relationship between theselves and among the team. It's sad because we had a pretty beautiful projet. 
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
You have lots of resources to learn any training you want like Salesforce azure aws etc. Also office has lots of snacks you can have for free. All remote work.
Great company to work for if you want a stable career. The only immediate concern is that you can't select a location on where you will work. They can even relocate you to other city even if you already rented a place on the first location you were assigned.
ProsGreat teammatesConsLots of overtime on some of the position
Existen muchas herramientas y facilidades para apoyar el crecimiento personal y profesional de los empleados, el trabajo puede ser home office dependiendo de las actividades. Es una empresa muy inclusiva y muy atenta al personal. No había conocido una compañía tan comprometida con los empleados como Accenture.
ProsFacilidades a los empleados en todos los sentidos.ConsNinguna

ProsWfhConsNot competitive salary
Innovative work. A unique, diverse workplace environment. Great work culture. High CORE values. Fantastic opportunities and career development. Overall, it was a great and memorable experience working with Accenture. 
Great People to Work with always there to help. Management cares about the employee and does care for the values They have amazing people that are ready to support and help employee grow 
ProsGreat People to WorkConsProject can be stressful
In general company provided good apportunity for new beginners, you will strugle at the beginning but at the end  you will fly. I would say Accenture is a great trumpline for those who wants move in the future to bigger companies like Google or Tik Tok. 
ProsSnacks and warm atmosphereConsVery bad menagment, who never support for career development. It is only for loved ones easy to grow in this company.
Never had my quarterly review so I never got any feedback on my strengths or weaknesses. Management seemed to be all over the place and not really aware of what was going on 
Good hours and ok pay. Work life balance is the best part of this job. The majority of the company is back in office and they took away most of the remote work. 
There are clients that aren't really fun to work with coz they look down on you.  Fast track of positions are only valid if you're favorite. Yearly salary increase are not that high.
ProsWfh set upConsToxic client, favoritism with the managers
Excellent staff and team. Worked internally and was happy with culture. Opportunities and benefits are there and should be taken seriously. I enjoy the people and work.
There are plenty of opportunities to learn new things and work with a variety of different people. You get to own your career and work on what interests you.
Work life balance is great, you are never pressured to work outside of your 40 hours. Not sure what “culture” they are talking about. Overall decent job with many promotional opportunities.
I enjoy working here the pay is good for the required work. Very laid back,  no micro managing but there tends to be some inconsistent information always going around and some of their picks for management are extremely disappointing..
Accenture is a great place to work. They invest in people and truly believe in growing their people while allowing them to manage their career. I love Accenture 
Only join them if you want to lose your sanity. The workers may be toxic, but they are also the most basic mfs you'll ever meetOnly join if you need money but gtfo immediately
Great place to work, friendly, supportive, and professional colleagues, most importantly I love the Accenture learning system, there is always something new for employees to learn. 
Great place to learn quickly and grow fast. There are plenty of opportunities but could be demanding sometimes, even if this is normal within consulting companies. 
Good career opportunities is offered. Good leaders and managers. Family-feel environment. Good benefits. You will be given a chance to change career path inside the organization
A lot of projects at the same time, no proper way for supporting new collaborators for adapting the  face pase. Asumtions about you and the way the work should be done. Bosy management in place of leadearship
ProsEnsurance, salaryConsPoor communication and structure for work
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Stability but hard to promote. Good benefits.Depending on the project the work life balance can be good. A lot of burocracy. After few years, promoting is harder.
Great workplace culture with a diverse, global and intelligent group of people. The work-life balance at my location was superb with the flexible option to work from home and team building events annually. Accenture truly invests in your learning and advancement as soon as you're hired. There are literally thousands of courses available to you within the portal to not only help you succeed in your role but perhaps move on to something new within the company. Management was just OK. Sometimes they play favourites but that seems like human nature and par for the course in any job/career role.

 The sense of professionalism marks every employer of Accenture.They make sure to give you every aspect of life.How individual decision-making can affect your life.They introduce crucial concepts such as networking to young adults all over the United States.
Boring job, routine . Good benefits. Need to be too focused on work. Control is strong Boring job, routine . Good benefits. quick management and possible to present your ideas
Like the title says, a good place to start a career, long term travel and client demands can be tough. Good brand name and a lot of opportunity given the global footprint of the company. 
Enjoyable place to work. Great training, smart people, lots of opportunities to learn. Positive culture. Variety of clients. Never have the same day twice.
Great place to work. Felt very welcomed by current analysts who showed me the ropes. Lots of events for TDP and analysts as well as an overall company. 
Worked in different projects for almost 3 years and flipped my life upside down during the pandemic to make WFH work. Now the team is returning to office and we got no help from HR to transfer within the company for those of us who cannot RTO. I dont have a car and they will not work with me to find a solution. Expected to roll off this month. 
Accenture is a great company to grow and learn in. My Career Counselor promised I would be challenged and learn new skills that I could take with me and this is a fair assesement.
ProsChalleningConsNone
I have been working in this company for about a year, and I gained experience from the very good management of both officers and managers, including the method of training, and it is a very large company.
A lot of the team leaders are contractors who are trying to gain full-time positions with Accenture. They throw you all the way under the bus and hopes of progressing themselves. Leadership comes across as very inexperienced unorganized and unprofessional. If you can get past that the pay is pretty decent.
CFM is a great place to launch a career. You will be entrusted with delivering forecast and results analysis to Manager, Senior Managers, and Manager Directors early almost immediately.
Accenture provides the tools to succeed. People there care about what they do and I generally felt acknowledged for a job well done. There can be limited upward mobility depending on the business, however.
Accenture is known for delivering high quality work on time to clients. With this in mind, an employee should be ready to 'pull out all the stops' to complete their objectives.  The work is exciting, since you're putting in the newest or best process. However obstacles and delays will create stress, since you have to work extra hours to clear those hurdles. No one wants explanations (i.e. excuses).The right person for Accenture is 'Type A' personality, getting hard things done with a smile.
ProsGood work env, bright people on team, good managementConsTough and tight deadlines, no work/life balance if you want to a good rating
Good company to work with especially if you are starting your journey after school. Accenture has a lot to offer - skills and experience. And benefits are awesome too
Many long hour days and sometimes weekends. Clients have high demands and it's expected of you to meet them. It will be hard to maintain relationships outside of work.
There were lots of angry claimants and back to back calls. The rules weren’t strict. The TLs were there for assistance. Daily huddles helped and training was thorough. 
La mejor empresa en la que he trabajado, ambiente super inclusivo y super relaxExcelentes beneficios 
El ambiente en la empresa al principio está muy bien, con mucha gente joven con talento y motivada. Luego, conforme se gana experiencia el ambiente se vuelve muy competitivo y la exigencia en horas de trabajo es muy elevada. 
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Ok place to work, very metrics driven. Great pay and benefits and bonuses for achieving metrics. Not much room for advancement but a decent enough place to work if you like call centre's.
Everything is good except some management politics , apart from that everything else is good Very good clinets and shorter bench duration so that's required 
Pros: back office low call volume $18 per hour Cons: Micromanage Supervisors have bad attitude Constantly threatened to be terminated from the jobI did enjoy the job only because it’s slow 
Large organization with many talented workers and opportunities . Pay is low as compared to market if you have stayed in the organization for a long. Although it depends on the client and the project,  the work hours sometimes are extremely long  and no appreciation for hardworking people. Lots of politics and honest/talented people are crushed. Gossipy and political management.
By far, the most horrible work experience in my life. I'd rather stock shelves at HEB or Walmart. Accenture has terrible management, no HR support, and love sending a ton of self-inflated emails 100 times a day that mean nothing to the peons they hire to ripoff Meta.
Great management and benefits.  Accenture is a well run company.   When I left I had over 5 weeks of vacation.  There is a lot of opportunity for growth and management looks out for you. 
Prosflexible schedule and good peopleConsnothing
Good place to work, and nice projects,learning scope,emoloyee benifits,work life balance is good,scope for learning if we got good project,overall it is good 
ProsTeamConsvariable bonus
Having worked at smaller companies previously I am excited at the scale of Accenture and the almost limitless opportunity to further my career here in fields that interest me. 
This company is very land back when you are on a contract. I love the people that I work with and everyone is supportive. It’s like family. The work can be repetitive so if you want to do different task everyday then these contacts roles are not for you.
Accenture is a great place to launch your career. It is stressful at times, but there is a plethora of good people that are willing to help. You drive your own career at Accenture which often feels like looking for a job even though you're already hired. 
I have never felt such a strong connection to the people I work with before this job.  The work is interesting, not always exciting but interesting for sure. There are opportunities for growth and career advancement. The organization needs to continue to be diligent about getting more diverse and unique perspectives into roles of leadership. 
It’s not about what you know, it’s who you know. Nepotism/Favortism are king. Performance be damned, only important thing is if you brown nose your manager enough. 
ProsSteady PaycheckConsWork Culture, Corporate Slavery
Great company to work for. They really took good care of everyone during the pandemic. Even with the work from home setup during the pandemic, our team stayed in touch with each other and it felt like one big family. Everyone is quick to help out with whatever you need help with. 
Is a very team-like atmosphere and many people to help and reach out to for what you need from Systems Support, access to tools and resources to grow. Many opportunities available to you but it is scary to be between projects without the promise of smooth transition from one project to the next.
ProsWork from home opportunities for proper work and home balanceConsVery short lunches and breaks and micromanagement with regard to time and metrics. So-so pay.
Accenture is really one of the best tech companies in the Philippines. Aside from the great compensation, there are free trainings and certifications that you can avail.
Learning Java is nice especially when it is focused on Spring Framework. Management will depend on your project. Mine is Meeeehhh..   But Accenture itself is awesome.
ProsBonus, Awesome Team mates, Auto Approve leaveConsnone
I’m a current apprentice and went to school for software engineering. In such a short amount of time, I have learned a LOT! I really enjoy the work/life balance and my current team is incredible. You might work on a project that you don’t think you’re qualified for, but somewhere along the line, someone saw the potential in you and took you under their wing. There are so many opportunities to learn and grow. You’re going to meet some very smart, kind people in this company, I promise they are out there. This is definitely a company that I feel so grateful to work for. There will always be someone available if you ever need help or just want to talk about anything and everything! I’d highly recommend this place.
Lots of opportunity - can move around the org ; lots of people could get lost in the mix if you don't know the right people. Overall 10/10 recommend. 
When I got this job, I was super excited to be working within the industry I loved for so long. Though after 2 years there, the spark had left, I was doing the same data entry research day in and out with seemingly no way to move up or switch teams. 
I'm excited everyday when it's time to work. I look forward to making an impact with my team and them with me. Our team is very supportive and fun. This helps the day to go by fast and feeling accomplished

Great company to work for … great benefits .. great training . Only downside is only give out contracts .. but pay is great .. managers are great .. it’s worth it 
Loved my job. Traveling was great but it became too much when you have a family.  Great people and I learned a lot.  The managers were sometimes not as knowledgeable as you would need them to be
I was extremely satisfied and honored to be a part of such an amazing enterprise. When needing to take Personal Leave of Absence due to circumstances preventing me the ability to get to work (atx) from SA.  When putting yourself on personal leave you are well aware that your job is not secure but considering the amount of time I was moved from Team to team, not to mention the onboarding process took over 2-3 months, I was relieved of my role on day two of my personal leave. If I was given the chance to take care of my vehicle situation, I would have been right back to work and an asset to the company. I find it a bit unusual that I was contacted by my team lead about my role being replaced in such a short period of time, especially when I know they have been hiring and have needed people to fill these positions. I know the inner workings, and I'm more than capable of excelling at any position given to me if the opportunity were to present itself. Other than this one instance with this certain Superior, the rest of the entire organization or something I would choose as a career for the rest of my working days.
Accenture is an amazing place. Lot of learning opportunities. The whole group look for upward  movement there is a culture of taking a chunk of your manager work at each level. Salary for old employees are not par with new joiners.
I love working at accenture mostly due to my manager. He is extremely knowledgeable and has helped me learn a lot in my role. I do find it is hard to move up especially as an accenture flex workers. 
Very up or out mentality which I  do not like because the only thing anyone cares about is getting promoted. Hours are long more often than not and you experience is very dependent on how lucky you get when it comes to projects 
The company set core values that is being practiced by all level of the organization. I still take pride that I got the chance to work for Accenture. 
Easy interview process.Training is a few days then you're put taking calls, but you can reach out for assistance as needed. Be prepared to handle irate clients daily. 
"While working as an Intern at Accenture, I was assigned to a projectr which I had a lot of interest in, however, it seemed as though the PM team I was assigned to were not prepared for an incoming intern and the first week was spent doing nothing, no meetings to attend and no assignments given to work on, even though I asked my lead & team members practically everyday for something to do. Their response as usually ""nothing at the moment, but if something comes up ill contact you"". After the first week it picked up and I started attending more meeting, taking notes, etc. I still did not have a lot of tasks to work on that I felt had a whole lot of ""value"" to them. Overall the people on my team were supportive and welcoming and I took advantage of opportunities to connect with higher-ups and network."
-lot of room for growth, you drive your own career-Company is large so the people really depends on your group-Company is constntly changing which can be annoying at times-Talent pool has become watered down
Hard work pays off if you are confident and understand how to sell yourself. This job is a true meritocracy. Will need to be able to be self directed and to navigate ambiguity in a company this large. 
The compensation is good and the people there were fun to be with. The downside is you work 9 hours a day. They offer work only from Monday to Friday.
This is by far one of the best places I have worked. The work-life balance compliments the team of management that support you every step of the way, throughout all situations & processes. Their mental health wellbeing of each employee is super important and are always there to assist you with you and your families needs. Other companies should take notes or used Accenture as their direct source of hiring and managing the best of the best of your employees. Salute Accenture 🫡
Overall a pretty good place to work. Very flexible on schedule to allow for personal things and making up the hours to get your work done. Managers are generally quite good.
ProsFlexible scheduleConsPromotions can be limited depending on department
The Good part is Compensation is good than other service based and bad is Not getting relevant project as per the skill set you have .expecting projects as per my skill set but not .no challenging work. we can change your project by requesting but it is a lengthy process.
ProsGood compensationConsNot getting project as per the skill
Accenture has much to offer internally that few take advantage of (e.g.) training, certifications, etc. They will take as much as you will give so establish your boundaries early on.
ProsSeemingly unlimited opportunities to learnConsWork / Life balance
Very happy in my current role. Work with great colleagues on interesting and complicated projects. Particularly impressed by the mentorship and training provided.
I like working here, has been flexible with WFH since the pandemic and good opportunities to grow career. I have worked with good co-workers 90% of the time
Great benefits, great people. Extremely high expectations and competitive. Compensation does not keep up with inflation and the only way to get ahead is to get promoted, which can be difficult even for a high performer. Leadership says they care about the burn out this creates, but fall short in execution which drops the problem in middle management’s lap.

Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
The company has become big without concerning management and reputation of it. The quality of projects and management has declined vastly. A lot of discriminations are taking place.
I've worked for several different companies and I've never experienced a place that encourages open communication, doing your best work, and holding everyone accountable as Accenture does. I am surrounded by highly experienced and intelligent team members, everyone here is truly passionate about delivering an excellent customer experience.
Proscompensation and benefitsConslong working hours
Nice people I work with, the work from home setup is handy and the wage is adequate for the work I am doing, the task at hand would be so easy if there was a dedicated POC for queries, the contract I am on should be so easy, no communication or clear instruction whenever you are stuck, left to rely on colleagues who are in the same boat.Manager just pushes it off onto teammates, wouldn't mind, but the job would be so easy, takes 5 seconds to answer a question that would save hours of time and ambiguity on certain things, the workload piles on, then your asked why you haven't finished, and the stress throws me off focus. not happy here.  and sent from pillar to post when you want someone to advise on a process. Thus could be a me problem, well I know I am not the only one, high stress for something that seems so straightforward, limited instruction. but that's my experience, I don't want to leave, I feel this could be fixed so easily or once you know certain things you're golden, but stress outways all ATM 
I might be a bit biased, but I went from a small consulting company to Accenture and the culture was non-existent in my group. Work life balance was fantastic, but felt like my base was a bit below market. 
ProsBenefits are good, excellent 401k and healthcare optionsConsThey used to give free lunch via Uber to remote workers, they have gotten stingy with lunch - it made me feel less valuable, the culture on my team was non-existent, you can definitely feel like a cog in the wheel
What is the best part of working at the company?Great environment, fair pay, constant improvement and certifications.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?You need to do extra things so you are accounted for promotion, thing with that is that, it depends how is appreciated by your leads, far beyond your effort.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very nice environment.What is a typical day like for you at the company?Constant learning and fully committed to maintain ethics and professionalism.
What is the best part of working at the company?Work culture What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Very much client specific which creates pressure on employees
What is the best part of working at the company?best colleaguesWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?unlucky with insensitive client
It is a good place to work but in consulting it is very much dependent on the client that you are working for daily. Leadership is very supportive and they try to do their best based on the available budget.
awful training chaotic job under paid stressful. Don’t care about you just a body to them don’t waste your time Management chooses favorites promote lazy people 
Onboarding process was great, lots of information about how to navigate the company, who to ask when issues arise. Pretty great work schedule flexibility and pay
Best Company to work, Best company ever! Lack of growth opportunities in dept. Pay is competitive. Great company culture.                                                                    
ProsBenefits, SalaryConsPolitics
Worked there remotely during the pandemic. Always was able to communicate with supervisors and was always treated with respect. Extensive training, and they want their employees to succeed.
La empresa es lider en su rubro. Sueldos por debajo de la media del mercado. Mucha rotación de personal
The company takes personal lives and matters into account and understands when people need to take time off to deal with issues or problems at home. Manager was very understanding and training was sufficient for projects.
What is the best part of working at the company?Lots of opportunities/internal career marketplace if you're open to working hard and proving yourself. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Because of the many branches of this company and projects, luck of the draw on if you're working with quality people or not.
Overall great org but you have to truly fight for promotion of work for just the right person. With everything in shared services and outsourcing model 1 it’s impossible to get HR or personal assistance when needed
Very difficult to get raises and you have to be above a certain level in order to bonus. Woke culture throughout the company. lots of training and its usually IT and will pile up quickly.
Prosremote work, easy schedulingConswoke culture, lots of training outside of your area of expertice, lack of raises and no bonuses.
Not great. Management does not care about employees . They took away all of the benefits that we used to have. The office is very quiet and boring. Not fun
The place is challenging but the salary is reasonable and there room to grow, at Accenture depending on the products you will be relocating to other places per project bases but most of the expenses are covered.
Good pay and hikeShift allowances Respect for individualNo location boundaryLiitte hectic in support project and weekend shiftsLess work life balance 
ConsJob security and work pressure in support projects
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Very bad management team, disorganized.They do not care about their employees, terrible system and management. Getting promotions are very odd and they will never appreciate your effort, very bureaucratic company.
ProsExperience, cvConsSalary sucks, no improvement
Never a dull moment. Always learning, always collaborating, always taking on new projects, always teaching. Experience may vary based on both business unit and clientele.
Always learning, always moving, always training, always teaching, never in stasis. Projects change, clients change, coworkers change, I doubt you'll be bored, thats for sure. Treats employees of all walks with respect.
Pros:Diverse to some extent.  Interesting projects.  Okay pay.Cons:  inadequate leadership, staffing of projects without a north start of success, and micromanagement.
Phenomenal culture for such a large company, let alone a management consulting firm. Frustrations stem more from the client-side of things. Great benefits, solid mentorship and learning opportunties. 
The Accenture name was the only thing of value I took from my time with the company. Specifically Flex is a hole where the layers of managerial bureaucracy and Yes Men make it almost impossible to move up the ladder.  If you're looking to make a move into the tech industry, this is an option to gain that first year of experience. However, look elsewhere before settling for this stagnant firm.
Good: Management, good pay and benefit, great work life balance. Opportunity to travel around. Bad: Difficulty to align personal development goal with assigned project.
My title summarizes all.I joined this company for my passion of Software developing.And for sure there are various of opportunities to engage with high tech projects, but in reality my department offshoring almost 90% of the coding work to East Asia or India. Hence this explains why the company tends to promote people with better client relationship building or management skill.
ProsA lot of techs, opportunitiesConsSales person promotes way more faster than techno person
I would like to write good comments about the company, but unfortunately I could not find anything to write well. Salaries are really very low and not raised, there is not enough training given from company about the job content, the management is really bad and sometimes they don't even answer our questions. They put a lot of pressure on us to reach the daily goal. This situation needs to change immediately.
A great place to start a consulting career.  You may be working very long hours at times, but will be working with like-minded individuals and you will constantly be learning new things and meeting new challenges.
ProsLots of opportunity for advancement, great leadershipConsNature of work is very demanding, high stress
Good culture and work life balance. Promotes good relationships and career development.                                                               
Job here has been pretty great. This company is a lot better than the other government contracting companies around the DC area. Management is strong, particular at the State account.
Accenture is a great place to work for, bad part is you never know when you won't have enough hours due to being a contractor. overall a great company to work for if you are a full time and they pay well.
What is the best part of working at the company?Fair pay. Good branding.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Recieving e-mail at midnight everyday. Seen people write a long paragraph/ do extra work that could just have been short just to show off or look sophisticated.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?The branding is great. However, I was under a not-so-good project. People are quite competitive individually rather than work together as a sport team. Working so late are considered normal and good.What is a typical day like for you at the company?tasks that clients dont wanna do
What is the best part of working at the company?People, work, benefitsWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Pre-covid, the travel was hard, but no longer an issue!What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Awesome, supportive, helpful
It's a good place to be if you're recently highered.Senior management is good, policies as well as HR is quite strong.No onsite opportunities.Join consulting or application development.Don't join infrastructure
ProsWfhConsNo work life balance
All in all I love it and would love to be able to make more money which I am just trying out the new bonus incentive but I hope to see some better pay for the work we do and the support we get it’s amazing they really try to make sure your successful 
ProsWork from homeConsBase salary pay rate

It was a great experience working there, advancement and long term could have been better but for what it was it was good.Over the two years I was working with Accenture I was allowed to explore ideas and improve upon the work I did.
Best experience I have ever had in a company, they are great and rewarded my hard work. However I was not entirely happy with my position, but becuase I did not like what I was doing.. I'd love to come back and do something different 😃
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Worst place I’ve ever worked. All they care about is your stats. They don’t offer much to keep employees. Low pay and annoying customers. Management is a bunch of young people with very little people skills c
Experiences depend on the project. I’ve had great managers and I’ve had really awful managers that have prevented me from advancing. Advancement is not guaranteed even if you work hard and put in a ton of OT. I’ve been overworked to a point where I couldn’t sleep and experienced depression. Meanwhile I know people that started with me and have the same experience and they can take naps at work but still get promoted. Pay increases and promotions depend on whether or not your manager will advocate for you not based on the how hard you work. The company has a good vision and could be great if they paid market value and promoted the employees who work hard and want to make a difference. 
The work varies by project, but mine can get quite repetitive once you get used to it. The pros of the company is that they are usually not hesitant in paying out compensation for work on Holidays if labor is insufficient.The overall company culture implemented is quite good, as there are multiple initiatives launched to support company-wide employees.However, it falls short when it comes to individual projects. Accenture leadership have not been too pro-active when it comes to diagnosing problems within individual projects.For our project, there are several problems.Management can be slow to address updates. Whether internal company updates or project updates, floor analysts are sometimes notified at the last minute. Attrition rate. Granted that different projects have different circumstances, the turnover rate is pretty high considering the amount of people within the project.I've not seen any steps taken to address the issue to lower attrition rate, even for well-performing individuals.
ConsVery strict and inorganic time management
Great experience, good pay, loved my coworkers and learning experience. The hours could be long at times but overall a great experience. Highly recommend.
Very supportive team environment. The work itself would have been demoralizing, but the support I got from the company and my supervisor made it all worthwhile!
ProsSupportive bossConsAngry customers
I really enjoy working at Accenture in their Technology practice. Many art and effective people along with solid leadership who is inclusive and respectful. 
Like the atmosphere, helpfull management, a lot of trainings to keep you up to date, free snacks, meeting new people from all over the globe and new friends. 
If you bring back work from home arrangement, people will stop leaving. Also, please stop terminating people without doing the study if their roles are essential
ProsGreat communityConsSome managers doesn’t care
"Nothing good to say, run while you canPros- NOTHINGCons- EverythingHard to get promoted, all about who you know, they can care less about working hard or knowledge. Just be part of the ""Cool"" kids."
Accenture has much to offer in breadth - so much to learn especially new tech /digital, new innovative acquisitions. Leader selection has improved with stronger focus on people leadership. Biggest concern is leveling and career paths for experienced hires. Experienced hires with 15-20+ Vp/C-Level prior roles leveled with 6/7 yrs Accenture only experience is nonsensical. Should be a specific exp hire Role- L5 - with short path to MD or stay L5 as expert/TL, with a peer group cohort program focused to ramp gap skills quickly (with coaches) and intentionally so we gain the powerful value of real experience and credibility with Accenture skills quickly. 90% of tte leaders in my current leadership program are not happy and ready to leave. Secondly - our bonus plan is the worst I’ve seen anywhere - even banking. I was used to a minimum $50k bonus often close to $100k - here a $10-20 bonus is hard to come by for SMs. And deceptive info about the bonus in hiring. My new hire RSUs expire after this year and it doesn’t appear they extend them - my comp will take a big hit - of course I’ll leave. Tech replaces your RSUs as long as you perform and they let you know so you don’t leave. Lastly the health benefits /out of pocket cost is excessive - very expensive compared to tech and smaller consulting. We get away with this bc most talent doesn’t know any better - homegrown. I have met some great people here and learned a lot - but investment in IP is limited /we can’t compete on our methodologies/tools - it’s all ad hoc /offering development barely exists  which makes delivering quality - more...
ProsLots of new tech, variety of projects provides great learning. Marketing funded research is good as well.ConsExp hire leveling, low bonuses, low investment in offering devt, career path for experienced hires a mess
For a company that is over 600k of people, it is very toxic.  People will tell you that you will get help for a project and then disappear.  Everyone's goal is to climb that ladder (which if OK) however someone needs to hold and support the ladder!They will advertise certain technologies but it is all vapor ware.  Reminds me of the someone selling Snake Oil.
good work culture, management is fine, proper training , ease to do work, proper facilities, human centric, need to improve due to less growth opportunities
Great company and culture. Compensation could be higher. Access to training needs to be updated so th as to all employees would be able to take courses.
Lots of travel, tons of stress, but not lots of learning or work to do. Boring job fixing PowerPoints and doing meaningless work. Great benefits and I did like the inclusiveness. 
The pay is not bad to start for entry level tech professionals. Great culture, great work environment and tons of learning opportunities. The new office that was renovated looks amazing!
You can do whatever you want at Accenture. As long as you can hold a conversation, you'll do just fine here. Everything is in your hands though, which is a good and bad thing. 
Great place to learn a lot, get paid well and get great exposure that will open doors for the rest of your career. Travel can become cumbersome but comes with the territory.
full of politics, no good metrics for promotions, managers are oppressive, they assign people to random project, they don't respect evening hours, they oblige you to participate to social events 
As a consultant I was miserable. You get stuck on projects that just keep getting extended and it’s hard to get off of them or move to a project more suitable for your needs. 
ProsDiversity and Inclusion. Everyone helps each other.ConsProjects that extend beyond the projected timeline. Some can even last years.
Accenture is an incredible company and gives junior folks a great opportunity to learn and grow. People are generally very respectful of each other, eager to learn, talented, and supportive. You need to be proactive about guiding your career, but there is no shortage of potential mentors/sponsors to support you.
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Count on it to take a while before you find your footing, and get placed on projects, which you are responsible to manage and instigate for yourself. Infrastructure is geared towards starters, as an experienced hire you may have a hard time in the beginning to figure out what your thing and your place is in this company. At the end of the day it is really about who you know, who knows you, and you'll be fine, but you will need to develop that network. But once you find it, lots of interesting and fulfilling work.
As I have started with Accenture, it offered me lot of things to learn and grow. I will surely recommend to my friends and colleagues. Best consulting place to work
One great thing about Accenture Technology Center is that they are open to accepting anyone, be it fresh graduate or someone from entirely a different field, as long as you have got passion for IT. It is a great organization for people starting out on their IT Career. They have got lots of trainings, as long as you're willing to learn. It is a must to have that urge to learn things not familiar to you, to expand your skills and knowledge.
Accenture is a good company especially for fresh grads, they offer trainings that will enhance your skills and abilities. This company has great culture and there's a work life balance.The only downside is the salary.
Loved the job, did not appreciate getting deactivated with no prior warning because I became ill during a pandemic. I did all the things called the attendance line let my supervisor know etc. But I went back to work and after 7 days they deactivated me. No explanation at all. As a matter of fact I was strung along for 3 weeks before I finally learned I was fired.
ProsWork from homeConsShort breaks, no tolerance for spending too much time with a caller, or taking too much time (I mean 30 seconds) to finish up notes on the call.
Accenture is a very big company and you will learn a lot of new stuff every day. You are in charge of your career so if you can't market yourself, promotions would take time. If you are assertive, then you'll go places.
ProsYou're in charge of your careerConsYou'll need to network a ton
They hired me for a job that didn't exist. I ended up on the bench immediately, was lied to about the job they made me take, and then found myself off of that 2 months later. At which point I had to find another job within Accenture within 2 weeks or be unemployed without having a network within Accenture, this process repeated until I found a job outside Accenture.
Great for the name but not much else. As a software developer it is easy to get pigeon holed into a project. They tell you that your career is in your hands but that isn't true, there are a lot of politics and paperwork needed just to try switching your focus. Most of your work is based on what is hot at the moment that clients are paying for and not much else. Any awesome learning you want to get done usually needs to be done on your own time. Salary plays a huge role in the projects you can get. The higher your salary, the less opportunities you will have in my experience.
Accenture truly cares about creating an amazing company culture. They walk their talk when it comes to the company’s core values. Respect for the individual, diversity, and inclusion are taken seriously here. The benefits are fantastic as well.
ProsGreat benefits and company cultureConsVery micromanaging in my department
First off, the job itself isn’t terrible. It’s the people around that don’t know what they’re doing that make this job miserable. They also don’t hire the most competent people and I think it’s for a reason: So there’s no outrage at the wage they pay us. 
As an experienced hire the do not train you on their methodology.  You spend lots of time searching for answers.  I was unlucky and was staffed on two horrendous projects as a new joiner.
ProsRemoteConsStressful
I enjoyed my time working there. Great benefits great supervisor room for travel and growth. Most people got hired out by the companies that they were working for.
Very nice work culture with excellent work/life balance and decent benefits. They hire lots of analysts with little/no experience to be put on federal projects, most requiring some degree of clearance. 
ProsEasy to get into, good work culture, chill managers, benefits are decentConsLow starting pay, takes a while to get promoted, not much upward growth
Awesome place to start your career, the apprentice program has excellent training to help you be successful. Benefits are awesome and work life balance is a priority to them.
Company is nice, however operations projects are not that good. You don't learn anything new and it becomes repetitive after some time. No promotion opportunities much
It was hard at the beginning to understand my role and tasks but I got a lot of support from my team leader and colleagues. After a few months I went on maternity leave and I felt very comfortable knowing, that my workplace is waiting for me.
At asis, Management is supportive and it’s a great place to work and start your career. There is a culture that promotes learning and asking questions to better yourself. 
ProsGood cultureConsPay could’ve been better
Fun place to work with intelligent/supportive people, work is challenging. Very poor scope creep management, easy to get stuck in one specific role or on one specific client
ProsSupportive Management, Flexible work locationConsCan get pigeon holed into one skillset, Pay quickly drifts from market value, Long hours
Very demanding, high pressure environment but surrounded by great talent. Leadership supports inclusive culture. Women in tech supported to advance. Encouraged to use PTO. 
ProsMany areas to move around within the firm to explore new opportunities, and carve a career path that aligns with goals and interests.ConsCompensation not as competitive as the tech companies, work life balance is difficult, pressure to remain billable, have to find a new job every time your project or contract ends.
Great company to work for. Very friendly and approachable leadership. Plenty of programs and training for career advancement.                            
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Work life balance is considerable while working as an endpoint support specialist at AFS you will learn a lot about network security and infrastructure. 
Everything depends on the project you joined and the management you work under. Hike is pretty low though you worked hard and get all the appreciation from client
This is a great company to start with if you have no experience in business processing or project management. There are ways to build your career and network with all the endless resources, its just up to you to use them. Accenture offers a lot of benefits and learning opportunities but again, it is up to you to find and use them on your own time. There are lots of projects and workflows that need help so, the job security is there however, if a project you are on ends, it is up to you to be proactive in finding a new role within the company. There are HR reps that assist but ultimately, you have control of your career here. Accenture is willing to exhaust resources to ensure their employees are cared for. Great starter company
Plenty of career advancement opportunitiesCompetitive payGreat benefitsDecent managementRespectful of pto and work life balanceOpportunity to for skill advancements 
I was provided training very often and the raises and bonuses were generous. I started off as a junior network administrator and ended up leading the team about three years later. Work/Life balance was great and remote work was afforded to accomodate our odd ball hours as IT professionals (pre-COVID).
ProsGood experience and great work life balance.ConsASM Research needs more oversight.
Typical day is 8 hours, flexible timeHardest part is time managementLearn about insuranceLove the remote qualityEnjoy helping customersGreat working environment
Awesome place to work , Great work life balance , Decent payGreat 401k and bonuses and great job security if you perform wellManagement is helpful and very much aware of your aspirations 
Culture is great and laid back. Advancement opportunities available but job security is debatable as they tend to outsource your job and lay you off eventually. Pay is not great until you get to senior management positions.
Growth opportunities are less. Appraisal is good.Management is worst. Politics at its best. You can't think of continuing here for a long time. Depends on project to project for culture and work pressure.
Accenture is a wonderful company with amazing people. Everyday I come to work excited and leave eager and ready to come in the following day. I love this job!
Larger organization is modern, innovative with product and programs, but subsidiary business units are industrialized with a sweat shop component approach to operations.  I worked with a supportive and talented team, but I did not care for ops middle management style - the hard push for production goals.  I found local business unit leadership even less innovative. Lip-service is given to concepts such as collaboration, but the business unit continues the same approach when onboarding new clients - over-promise, lack of communication and training, and not forward thinking which result in repeat delivery challenges.  Slow to promote or give raises, but benefits are good.
I a good place to work, good benefits, and great people. working from home allows easy work life balance. try to make is fun and engaging with working from home and interacting with co workers with a weekley online happy hour. they promote wellness of mind and body. 
ProsmoneyConswork can be monotonous.
Basically like being self-employed but you had a steady stream of income. Chargability metrics are firm (80%+) but not super impossible as long as you keep looking for roles. So good for self-starters who want to put in the work to network, do extra business development to get your next role, etc., or for those looking to transition late in career to expand beyond their current experience + skillset.
ProsVirtual work + ability to pivot within companyConsWLB can be hectic / not always fully in your control based on project, HR pushing for changeability if you don't go from project to project
not bad just alot of people training at once. trainers are helpful, they approve sick days in advance. everybody gets along. one thing i didnt like is one day we had work next day we didnt. 
It is not a good place to work. There's nepotism, discrimination, and a whole lot of other unethical behavior unless you're one of the chosen few.  There is no enjoyable part of working at Accenture. Management is in their own little bubble and have no idea or training about how to handle their roles and deal with employees respectfully.  The culture is an in group/out group type of environment. 
Unless you enjoy constantly stressing that you have a job or can find a job within their company, I do not recomend them. We we informed of things and then they would change their mind at the last minute. Not worth the headache or paycheck
ProsSalary and free goodies like shirts, hats, etcConsYou are just a number
Nothing bad. All good things to say. If I had to say something about the company it would be typical consulting hours and culture and team dependent..
Accenture is a global company and you can always find help in different means. Leadership has great integrity and will always try to listen to your concerns. Salary is less competitive than other consulting companies
ProsGood work cultureConsSalary less competitive
Great place to work.Worklife balance is good.career growth will be less.Good to start your career and have to be proactive.the work environment is awesome.Support is less in work.
A great place to work. I enjoyed being remote. Questions and concerns were answered in a reasonable time. Everyone was onboard with you being great at your job. 
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Terrible work-life balance, too  many hours or code,  understaffed projects . Every experience is different but you would feel a number If you get in. 
The managers are nice . Great pay and work environment. Hours are great. It was a great learning experience for me. I highly recommend you will not regret it
Company appears to be more transactional than strategic than big 4. Leadership support, mentoring, feedback processes can be improved.  Benefits are comparable to industry.   
I really like everyone I work with at Accenture Federal Services. There is good job stability, and I appreciate all the events Accenture organizes and free swag I've gotten. It can be hard to stand out or find your place in such a large organization, but that also means there's a lot of upward mobility. 
You work really hard and get paid very well for it. It is very stressful since it is client driven. If you do not have excellent time management skills this may not be the place for you. You can tell they really care for the employees and have several employee engagement events through out the year. However, sometimes it feels like you are being pushed to join these events even when time does not permit.
ProsGreat payConsStress
Accenture was an overall good place to work. It all really depends on which account you land on. The management on my account was worthless. It was very sad because the account was once thriving and one of the top accounts in North America. 
ProsRelaxed work environment, PayConsManagement
Network your but off and find a project and management team that will help you grow. Visibility is extremely important for promotion, so the more people who know you and your skill set, the better.
Accenture is a great place to learn professional skills. It’s demanding and fast-paced, but management is responsive and supportive. There are many opportunities to advance, but you have to seek them out. The culture is respectful and progressive.
ProsOpportunities to advanceConsWork/life balance, Compensation
Great place to work. Good work life balance and fair pay. Management is usually very talented and also fair. Pre-COVID traveled about 75-80%, however was a remote worker on non-travel days. All in all, great consulting company.
Accenture is a massive company, but I always felt sufficiently supported by my managers. The benefits are nice and you’re not overworked. As long as you’re responsible and focused on getting the job done, you’ll do very well and receive advancement opportunities. 
It's a great place to work if you like to be challenged. There's a ton of opportunities across various industries and clients, so there's always opportunity to learn something new and gain experience. 
I’m not used to office jobs but this is definitely easier and chiller than any other job I’ve had. Managers don’t really care about you and act like you’re a bother when you come to them for help but that’s the worst of it, other than the food they provide is usually cold and unhealthy:/ it’s free, tho, so who am I to complain. The job has perks definitely, but the monotony of refreshing and reloading time and again gets draining.
ProsFree lunches, short shifts but great compensation, lots of breaksConsBoring, repetitive, management is disorganized and uninterested in employees
 - Great company to grow personally and professionally.Pros :- Great opportunities a different kind of missions.- Big community who does not hesitate to help you in your daily job.Work can now be done remotely (since the pandemic) if compatible with project constrainsCons- Incomes variable is a plus- workload can be high and difficult to manage- Work and personal life balance can be off balanced
"This is okay as a first job experience for most of the people, but you will soon experience that work hours are really ""aleatory"", most of the times you'll end up working 'till late, without getting paid your extra hours."
Been part of accenture for 10+ years now. Pros would be job security , work life balance and support provided in terms of certifications and continuous  learning . Cons are that the work culture ,hikes and promotion depends on being in good books of project management. 
With Accenture you apply for certain position but get put into another position that you didn't apply for. All of the supervisors that are were great. They do try to recognize you for your hard work.
Don’t do it! Wasted five years doing work below my skill set. Excel, excel and more excel docs. Boring work. Most people have bad attitudes and have daily melt downs.
ProsThe name on your resume, learning toolsConsLong hours, disrespectful mgmt, no room for advancement.
One of the best company to work with and good work life balance. Provides free shuttle and cab to and fro if required. Provides great learnings. I have thoroughly enjoyed my tenure at Accenture.
Challenging projectsLearning new skillsFlexible working hoursAbility to grow professionallySupportive work environment Open communication with colleagues
Training was rushed, managers and leads were going through training too so once in production they wasn’t much help my supervisor didn’t know what was going on 
ProsPayConsDisorganized
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Find it very stressful working here, every day is different which could be a good thing but more often than not it causes anxiety and there's minimal support
Project work can be very interesting and depends highly on the people you surround yourself with and learn from. Enough opportunities to grow and do cool work across the org. Need to be cautious to not corner yourself in a specific area of the business.
ProsLots of opportunities, clear path for growthConsDoesn't feel like a cohesive culture across the company
Not organized! Management do not care about anyone & you will not get properly trained. Benefits are horrible!!!!! Pay is okay $18. They will drop you from your job without an explanation so be careful.
ProsPayConsThe job itself, management, & benefits.
The work is easy to learn and doesn't require much from you. You can depending on your department see some shocking stuff but they are very upfront about it in the beginning of the hiring process. The work does become a bit robotic and tedious but they do give you lots of paid breaks and food/snacks. Management for my team was pretty bad and there seems to be a lack of leadership. Culture feels fabricated and non existent to be honest. 
Fun place to work. A lot of breaks and free lunches sometimes. Can be micromanaged at times but that’s with any job. Work from home was a plus also. That’s it overall 
ProsFree lunchesConsMicromanaged
Ok needs more communication between departments. And more one on one direction. Not just a hurry through learning process. It’s a great company.Right
ProsNoConsGreat support groups
Really fun company culture, leadership is accessible and communicates well. Workforce is diverse and inclusive. Encourage work life balance, though it depends on the project you're on, easy to advance in the company, a lot of training provided 
ProsFlexibility, diversity, leadership, payConsCould give us more PTO/ sick days/ company holidays, sometimes your responsibiities are very ambiguous
Overall, my experience was positive.  I had mostly positive experiences at projects and through my experiences at Employee Resource Groups.  While I was more advanced in my career, it is definitely a great place to get started early or mid-point in your career.  
ProsBenefits were greatConsDefinitely times of unreasonable expectations, could do better with diversity and standing up for times when bad things happen
Nice and great place to work.. Interview process is easy. Management is not nice. They treat you as a resource. And can kick anytime from the project. Overall good place to work for short term
HR person are not approachable and very less pay these days. Only good thing is WFH Assistance Program. Job Level in Accenture is not as per experience. A lot of Politics.
ProsWFH Assistance ProgramConsHR person, Management, Less pay
Depending on how independent or open you are to networking, you have a bunch of opportunities to learn a new skill from your teammates or other fellow coworkers. 
They are the best company I have ever worked for. They are very flexible care so much about mental health and put your personal and professional needs above the company 
Great Company to work for and the pay is good, however not flexible with work schedule. If attendence if a issue for you then this job will not be a good fit . 
ProsPay and BenefitsConsFlexibility with work schedule and move you to different departments with no knowledge
Workplace culture is generally great, which is why I stuck with the company for so long. While there are periods of crunch that occurred for me, they've generally come only once every few years.The company seems to care about delivering high quality solutions for the clients, which I like, and my manager hasn't hassled me abotu any time off I needed to take. The applications I've developed have been fairly complex in an way that challenged me and kept me engaged.However, I've discovered the pay is grossly under market, particularly for more experienced developers. The company will adjust to the market in order to hire new developers, but seem unwilling to do so for people who have been with them for a long period of time.
ProsGood benefits, engaging work, great culture (manager dependent), good work life balance most of the timeConsBelow market compensation, poor training opportunitites, promotions can be slow
I enjoyed my tenure at accenture. I looked forward to working daily. The position was challenging, there was very little instruction and allowed me the opportunity to perform well on my own. 
ProsOvertime hours availableConsLittle training, requires a person to be great at self starting
Many feelings during this period but I always will remember how I feel right now : purposeless . Management is quite weak and some promotions are not well deserved. You will find people who are in the same position for a long time feeling themselves stuck and burned out. 
ProsDepends on the location
I had a great time at Accenture. I learned alot and gained great technical and interpersonal skills. The people were very friendly and supportive. Pay was very good. 
Helping environment, Good learning, paid fairly,supporting and collaborative work atmosphere, good infrastructure, Flexible work hours, employee friendly policies
Good place to work. Good place to learn and grow. Still I don't feel the job security here. I have learnt so many things in Accenture. In terms of tools, technology, practices. Whereas I got this opportunity to learn in avanade account. Not sure about other projectsRamp down and roll off are happening often to replace the high paid resource with junior resources. So many role replacement are happening. Which leads to hectic work of training the new resources and keep them up to speed.
ProsRecognition, Amazon gift cardsConsWork life balance. So much of practices, work to do.
Standard consulting life. Longs hours when trying to get things done. Requirements are constantly evolving with clients and sometimes it because a burden due to the numerous ask to be done within a small timeline.
ProsknowledgeConsdeadlines
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
This place has been the best company I’ve been with. Accenture gives many opportunities to its employees and moving up in the company is possible. I recommend.
ProsEverything is amazingConsDifferent pay depending on project
There are many projects, so I can't speak on all of them. But, my project is fine. They want you to succeed in this job, and provide training. It would be kind of hard to do bad. 
 Improve the work life balance. The company should work on reducing the stress on employees. Most of the time managers are very adamant to approve leaves. 
ProsGood facilitiesConsToo much of work pressure
Great place to work if you need a quick job. You get to work from home and hours are flexible as long as you get your job done. Potential for overtime as well. But as a contractor, you get no benefits and no paid time off. 
ProsWork from home, flexible hoursConsNo benefits, contract work means possibility of lossing your job after contract, very lottle chance of getting hired as employee
Good for regional experiences but limited exposure to global and most of them dont even seated in the same office and very limited PTO. Other than that they provide very good exposure to beginner. 
To keep it brief*, this is an excellent place to start your career out of college. Your first week in, you'll start with Agile training, learn the ropes, get basics on your role, and then be available to staff to a project. Depending on the length of the project, how long its been running, and the opportunities available, you'll be able to really succeed long-term in the company (+3 years).In terms of how your career looks after 2-3 years, you'll need to make decisions, train for certifications, participate in volunteer extracurriculars and really grind to really make it worth something. I'm talking an extra 5-15 hours a week depending on how many people you'll want invested in your success. Also a great time to expand your network (starting at year 1, but really opening your contact list in year 2-3).After about year 5, you'll need to reflect if you're interested in leadership or a high-demand technical role to acquire a competitve salary. If anything, at least your profile will be marketable to others outside of the company, especially with any security clearances, certifications, technical experience and any awards gathered along the way. If you decide to stay but aren't loving what you do daily, the grind can be intense and the demand can wear on your outlook. Otherwise, if you like working and/or a work-a-holic, you'll feel right at home.* your actual experience/mileage may vary; depends on if you get on a long-running project with a very supportive supervisor who will vouch for your success yearly (rare) to help you rapidly move up the ranks; at Team Lead/Consultant - more...
ProsSmart co-workers (younger/out-of-college), excellent benefits package, nice place to start careerConsSenior pay not competitive, work-life balance struggles over weekends, some supervisors need to be kept in check
Daily work include setting up daily goals, stay on the task until it's done, do one on one with manager & implement the manager's input. strive for best work.
Once you learn everything it is pretty chill (having been WFH) The team members and some of the managers are pretty cool and can be super helpful, especially when first starting. 
ProsOnce your shift ends, youre done.ConsPay could be better
Accenture has a in house agency called BCFORWARD. This company lacks concern for its employees. You are just a number to them. Nothing more. Bcforward only response via email. You can’t speak with anyone about your concerns or to request a change on a project due to conflicting interest or comfort ability on assignments. You can send email after email after email and nothing will happen for months. Don’t show up on an assignment and your phone rings! You state your issue and dead air. I will not recommend anyone to work for this company as they will demote without notice. Shuffle you around from project to project and have you feeling displaced on assignment. 
ConsLack of communication when employees have concerns.
Just like every other service consulting firm, your growth depends on the team you end up with and the manager you report to. Career growth depends on your rapport with your manager and your ability to project yourself.
ProsNew learning, Certification sponsor, 401K benefit, Espp, Generous PTO, Strong Immigration teamConsFinding a mentor is difficult. Longer work hours depends on Project demands.
Accenture as a company is great alright no doubt about that. But my work experience in the account I worked with was not satisfying at all. The process and my team lead did not made me the satisfied employee that I can be. 
ProsBig and stable companyConsTeam manager can be uncaring at all
I'm quite shocked at the poor management, and working environment. People are falling I'll, taking days off. They try and intimidate employees to work long hours.
ProsRemote workConseverything else
I worked for Accenture/Facebook for almost 2yrs. If you're into the corporate thing, then this is the place for you. For me, the layers and layers of bureaucracy was enough. Even when I notified them of my voluntary resignation, they wanted a first & second reason. Really? Accenture is absolutely the worst company to work for, and they've got the bait and switch game down to a science. The social media content reviewer position is about as entry level as it can get. If you want a job where growth is not your thing...this is the company to go with. 
ProsFree lunch, watch TV while working, mileage reimbursement, health benefits.ConsSays one thing and do another
Great place to work; work life balance varies greatly by project and focus area, but it's possible to craft a good working cadence.  It's also possible to lose yourself in the company and work too much - no one will stop you if you do.Career advancement is much faster than vs. industry, and on par with other consulting firms.Always learning new things every day.
"Accenture has awesome benefits and would highly recommend the ESPP.  Work/Life balance can be scarce at times, but you need to talk to your manager sometimes to explain your needs. They can be very flexible also; a few of my coworkers are ""part time"".  They do take care of their people."
Terrible place, hard for mobility in the company .They don’t have other contracts available once the current one ends . You literally are lied to the whole time 
They do a good job of promoting from within. Allows you to take off if you have an emergency. Friendly and fair management. Didn't like how processes were constantly changing however.
Pros1 hr lunchesConsconstant calls
RUN. I don’t even do reviews & never bad mouth a company. trash &  I wouldn’t recommend no one to work for this sad behind company. And team lead doesn’t know what they’re doing and when it’s a hot seat they only save themselves.
ProsPay weeklyConsBullcrap job. Barely get paid on time. Don’t track your hours.
Lawless leaders who do not follow the rules of law. They lack principles, morals, and respect for the individual. They're mostly concerned about ushering in a new world order where people are microchipped.
ProsSome good people left but not manyConsLiterally everything
The company provides an easy way to gain experience in what you want, but the pay is mediocre for the work, and advancement might take a long time to recieve.
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Pros: Brand name clientsCons: The very nature of the business and promotion path leads to a every person for themselves mentality. Nobody really cares about anything other then there own “story” for promotion. It’s hit or miss whether you learn a lot or a little on a project
Smooth onboarding, training is very minimal. You learn much more on the job and from other team members. There is also little room for progression. Good work-life balance. 
ProsFriendly, respectful atmosphereConsConstantly changing kpi's
It is very nice to work in this company. Offers always their best to their employees. Good culture. You're in the right hands with Accenture. What a nice company.
ProsAllConsN/a
A decent place to start your careers and one of the better among the consulting firms. Work can get overwhelming and hectic based on the project/client you get assigned
Pros401k, Health Insurance and other basic benefitsConsWork Life Balance
Amazing experience, The company pushes you to do better. Everything about this company is amazing and I won’t say anything less. Great people. Amazing leadership and superb balance
Accenture is so large that you have room to grow no matter your talent and skillset. On the flip side its so large that there a communities and networks you have to build in order to grow inside the organization
ProsBenefitsConsWork life balance
I have gotten a lot of experience at this company, but they are not interested in recognizing employees for their work. The company is currently bleeding employees and replacing them with US-based contractors or hiring FTE in low-cost countries so that they can save a few bucks rather than investing in and promoting the talented employees that they have. This is a good place to get some experience and then GET OUT.
Great contract job, there is room for growth, but it is a struggle not being pulled from a good project once you’ve accepted a permanent position. Can be a hit or miss. 
Accenture is a great first job for college graduates. The company provides an excellent  training program. The home officers are modern and provide perks for employees such as coffee and healthy snacks.
Poor management with no employee safety. Internal political parties which makes garty palce to work and grow. However, good place to work for those who Starting their career. 
ProsSalary on timeConsMany cons which can't be explained
Stress/workload is dependent on the project you belong to.  Once assigned in a stress free project- manageable workload then got assigned to a call center set-up project- v. high stress level-Low pay compared to other call centers.
ProsFree coffee, juice, lunch on overtimesConsThe company promotes work life balance through events WITHIN the company, with your colleagues and you can invite your family, which makes no sense as it still work-related.
ZERO Management to Employee Interface. They CLAIM that is the case, The WORST IT Network in the World. ZERO IT Support for critical breakdowns. New Management does NOT Understand the Roles of employees and does NOT Talk to them.  Management does NOT know effective Processes that employees are using and is completely Clueless. The Peers are the BEST!  They are the lifeblood and reason for any shred of company success.  
ProsExcellent PeersConsIT Breakdowns, No Help Desk Help, Complete Lack of Compassion and Understanding.
The culture and attitude of Accenture are amazing. They help support your progress and development. They need to work on the complexity and downright chaos of their site and resources. They also lack the integration and capability to fully utilize their talent pool. The skill matching system has great potential but is not quite there yet. Some of the benefits are good however the healthcare insurance options for US employees are very bad. They are not remotely competitive. Some projects are chaotic and have poor onboarding without much support. The focus on education is good however the implementation is poor. The courses are too generic and there are not enough of them to cover the skills necessary to maintain an innovative edge.
ProsDiversity, inclusion, good ethics, meritocracy (sort of)ConsBad healthcare, chaotic resources, lack of support
You MUST support the company's agendas, both professional, political, and it's easier if you are an atheist. Otherwise, they will tire of you and your ideals and either let you go quietly, or they will stab you in the back until you leave on your own. Up to you :)
ProsGood compensation (while it lasts)ConsNot the best work/life balance
Success and satisfaction depends on the type of project and leadership.Limited salary hikesGood parental leave                                         
Great company to work with and good management and team culture,  many training opportunities,  diversity,  inclusion, and diversed projects. It is a good company for everyone to work with because of their great work ethics, inclusion,  diversity with great management and staff. Also offers job security 
ProsCareer counseling, training, good work life balance, support and great managementConsLow income rates and yearly increments
Accenture is a great company with opportunities for growth, but work life balance has become an issue. Too much work and not enough resources in order achieve day to day work and stretch goals. 
The strongest area of the company is flexibility and overall work-life balance (if you know how to set boundaries). Salaries are not the best, but flexibility makes up for it. In general it is very complicated to have a mental image of the companies endless number of teams and processes, in which you loose a lot of time.
ProsFlexibilityConsBurocracy. Salaries not the best.
The Managing Director’s are condescending and rude. They will not answer any email from junior people unless it is an issue concerning a specific project. They routinely add themselves to projects if they have no work, even if it means that existing staff lose their jobs. If you don’t have a project to work on then you are at risk of losing your job. This is a unique culture where no one cares, there is no hands on management help and if you need a subject matter expert your attempts to get help will be ignored. The level of expertise is exaggerated to win business. All the hard work is done overseas. Self importance rules. Not a good place to thrive
ProsSalaryConsManaging Directors
Good support from team and many learning opportunities. Culture depends on the team that you are working with.Dynamic work and good opportunities to meet and work with different people.
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
It's Good CompanyProvide Best Work CultureYou will get help from your manager and Team Lead.Some time you have to stretch to complete the your work 
ProsGood WLBConsSome of the project are in old technology
Overall a good company with constant workloadGood company to learn new skills everydayPeople are supportiveFinding a work life balance is difficult
Prosgood benefits and salaryConsover expectation, constant prtessure
The team I worked on was passive-aggressive and not a great team to work with. There were times that emails I sent would go unread, and those same people who missed you would try and throw you under the bus for lack of communication.The managers do not care about the concerns that their teams have and often only have anything to say when things go wrong.
ProsNoneConsPoor team collaboration, poor support from managers.
Friendly environment & very good growth for freshers .Salary compensation can be increased bit more atleast to those who stay here for long.Also employees shall be encouraged to switch projects every 2 years so that one can unskill & have better exposure.
There are so many opportunities for growth. The company gives decent pay raises and bonuses each year. Ability to move around and try types of positions. 
ProsDecent pay, work life balance, management cares.ConsSome roles are short term
"I've worked with Accenture since 2016. I've had a few different roles and have worked with several clients. I've done medical claim processing and software testing - UAT and QA testing.In the medical claim processing area it's typically a pretty easy and stress free job. However, there is no room to move up and grow. The managers I've had were not very helpful and did not care to see their people grow. Also, the micro management is at an extreme. Every second is tracked. In the software testing area, the main issues I've had are: lack of training and horrible onboarding experiences. These projects tend to be more flexible with schedules and tend not to micro manage. Work/life balance is pretty good.You're experience at Accenture really depends on what you're hired for, what project you're working on, what client you're working with. Some projects are better than others. Also, watch out for positions labeled as ""Accenture Flex"". You will be paying triple the amount for insurance, you have less PTO, you don't get holidays off, you're less likely to get bonuses and raises. It's very had to get out of Flex, even when you try to transition to a non flex position... they will do their best to make you stay flex or make it impossible to transfer over."
ProsWork/Life balanceConsBad pay, Accenture Flex is not good, Insurance rates are high, not much PTO
Good salary, but terrible corporate culture. The Direction is directionless. Being a yes-man will move your career ahead. Lots of political games and backstabbing. The company is notorious for jumping on bandwagon of whatever is deemed to be in-fashion. Consequently, if you have an opinion that differs from the echo-chamber, better stay quiet or else everyone will isolate you and try to get you to leave the company.
This project is horrible and disorganized. The management is terrible. The only people that have the opportunity to be promoted seems to have a personal relationship with management. Many people have gone to Human Resources and filed complaints and nothing has been done about the environment. 
ProsAccenture Corporate is a good companyConsThe company is only good if you are on a good contract
Average workday is 9-13 hours and leadership is poor. I have yet to meet a good project lead that I can learn from. Toxic teams and lots of uninteresting work and lack of transparency across the board. 
ProsLearning opportunitiesConsNo WLB, bad leadership, boring projects
This job will make you comfortable so you wouldn't want to leave.The work/life balance is great, work stays at work. When you are off work, you don't have to worry about your job until the next day. The pay is somewhat generous for what you do at work. Your hours are very flexible and lenient. There are some micromanagement however.
ProsFlexible hours, good work/life balance, decent payConsmicromanagement, small room for growth
Accenture has made great progress overall as a company and that comes from great leadership skills and providing excellent customer relationship. I have worked on various projects for Accenture around Austin and the project you pick will largely determine whether you get growth/technological advancements or whether you get stuck and become stagnant.  Some projects do offer great compensations and some are very restricted on budget and might not offer any great benefits. 
ProsGreat work life balance, People care for each other, People help each other understand the business better, Employees strive to maintain great client relationship, Accenture offers great learning resources to build on your technical skills.ConsThere might not be opportunities for growth on certain projects.
Pros:Great company to work with. Have nice benefits and the salary is competitive. Big HMO package. Good training ground. You'll improve you IT skills. Nice colleagues.  Cons:Long working hours. 10 hours work day. 9 hour shift and 1 hour lunch
Great place to work - one of the best brands in the global business world. Company is massive, so it definitely takes effort and time to let that sink in and learn about the organization
It has very beautiful offices. They care about the employee a lot. Work pace is reasonable, never stressful. Also the cafeteria is really good most of the time. 
One too many former front boys in charge. No diversity. You can move up in the company if you play the game of being the right type of employee. Many times assignments are based on favoritism.
Demanding work environment with a lot of pressures, and limited support and resources. However you work with great people often on interesting work, there are also a lot of good benefits. There is also the opportunity to move into new areas and always a lot to learn. 
They hire you to do something but you end up doing something else instead. Disorganized. High expectations with no clear goal. Will blame you for their lack of communication. 
ProsFree water, you can ghost
Tech is the firm's bread and butter - it's what Accenture is known for and if you have a tech background, it's a great place to apply your knowledge to consulting. For pure play strategy , there is a wide definition of what exactly that entails and they are still trying to figure out how to stand out in that field. The inconsistency of training and support would make me hesitate from a strategy perspective.
Fully remote depending on the team, plenty of room for advancement or to another team, competitive pay/benefits, but your manager can make or break your job.
Accenture is a great place to work, especially if you enjoy networking, there are a lot of opportunities. Job satisfaction depends on role and team, make sure that you’re working an external facing role.
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking

Pay could be better. Good opportunity to move around different industries. Have ton join resource groups to get to know people outside of your projects. 
Old school boomers running the place. They work you 16-17 hours a day, every day, weekends, through holidays. Plus their leadership is terrible, they treat people like trash. then throw them out whenever they can replace them offshore or with importing people. It's shocking their stock has done so well....they still run interenally like the did back in the days of Enron. I don't even think they can spell SOX in finance where most of their finance people are in Buenos Aries, have no finance background and barely speak English. 
Prosit's a job if u need one.ConsTerrible culture and leadership.
...however I was hired as a mid-level/senior and I find it is tricky to advance in your career in Accenture as such. Work/life balance and stress levels vary depending on the project and I have had bad luck with projects. Job security is guaranteed however working hard and smart while being a team player won't get you a promotion. Learning new things is also dependent on the project. I wouldn't recommend to anyone to start working in Accenture as a programmer.
Proswork from homeConssalary, work-life balance, opportunities for advancement, management doesn't care
Love it! they are so helpful and the pay is good. I liked working from home so that was a plus and a lot of opportunities for growth which is always great. 
Accenture is for the most part a great company to work for and they have many talented brilliant people  working there.   They fall short when it comes to providing a good work life balance  for employees.
ProsGreat people. Good pay.ConsAdvancement at the lower levels is often based on who you know.
This is a great company to learn. But because its so big you can get lost in the mix. You will have to do a lot of digging to get the role that is right for you.
Its fun to work here and learn new things everyday. Team leads are very encouraging and supportive. Great for freshers and lot learning opportunities.
Proslearning, technology, professionalConsnon
Good place to start your career, however, no work life balance and client always comes first. ACN leadership doesn't advocate and protect their workers. It'll always be a client and money first industry. 
ProsNetworking opportunities with leadership, entry level pay, opportunities to work in different rolesConsNo work life balance, clients come before employees, HR is useless, very political
1.Overall Good Experience both for Professional and Personal Growth.2. Supportive Team Culture3. Appraisal Cycle is good4. Sometimes work Pressure is difficult to handle.
 The main client is a government cash-cow that nobody wants to be on. Also hard to get promoted if there are no good roles available to justify it. The general experience is sitting charging hours at a client site, doing your 8 hours of client work. On top of that, you are expected to do your Accenture work. 
ProsYou will gain weight a lot of meeting and a lot of food at the officeConsYou are having mandatory training that does not pertain to your job.
I work for Accenture Flex at client's base, not real Accenture. I never feel that I belong to the client or Accenture. Pay if not great. The company try to make employees happy by small bonuses but it's never enough. People is leaving.
ConsLow pay, almost no benefit if you're ACN flex.
Productive work at a great building with many amenities. Culture is good with friendly people. I learn a lot of new things every day and enjoy networking with people
Working at Accenture was as good as it gets.The customer and partner relationships enabled us to exceed.Upper Management maintained Customer leverage.
ProsQuality peers
Layoffs, Firing, Bullying, Groupism, Bossism, Unprofessionalism, Women Centric, Employees are Disposable, Worst Policies, Firing Every Year. If you want to Survive in Accenure then you should transform into a Women. 
ProsLayoffs, Firing, Bullying, GroupismConsUnprofessionalism, Women Centric, Employees are Disposable, Worst Policies, Firing Every Year.
Good to start here and obtain experience out of college. Managers and team leaders aren't always the quality you'd expect in this culture. Limited growth potential if you are at a client location. Team lead at my location was lacking in basic leadership skills.
It's a good international company. There are a lot of great people. It's a fast-paced environment with good opportunities to grow. The salary is not so attractive. 
ProsGreat teamsConsSalary
If I was a very young adult starting out in building a business track record to advance upon they fit the bill! In retrospect it is a proving ground for jr executives.
Cheating and lying are the nature of the business. No matter how hard you work and experience you have in the end they value liars and cheaters. Don’t expect getting promotion through hard work.
ProsFree waterConsShift biding, not valuing experience.
Fun, good professional development, offers a lot of trainings, Lots of overtime because of working from home. The management offers a lot of benefits to its employees.
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
We started during the pandemic so we were not able to do a lot of interaction with anyone working at the company prior to starting our employment with them.
Through COVID-19, companies have learned that they don't always need consultants on site. This is great if you have a family!Daily flexibility is wonderful - I've been able to flex as needed to spend time with my family and take kids to school
I would never work for this company again. they some dirt bags.just to give a example this person training when I was there quit right inthe  middle of training because they rush you and do not make sure you are trained well enough to do the job
Proswas able to work from home/pay was goodConsmanagement sucks, disrespectful unorganized
Accenture never really turns away  a bit full of money client and so there’s a lot of not so interesting projects that we are faced with working on. It’s great that we always have a lot of work but we also lose people regularly that get stuck working with a client that they would never work with otherwise.
ProsGood benefitsConsLittle respect for work life balance by senior managers
It's a brand to work with you get job security. The management is very biased and selects the people based on their liking rather than on the performance.
Its hard to get promoted if youre not well known even if high performanceYoure raise will depend on projects budgetLucky to belong in a projecy with high budget
ProsBenefitsConsUnpaid OT, low compensation
This is good for training ground if you are looking for learning opportunities. But not recommended for skilled professional. You can gain lots of experience here.
ProsLots of learning opportunitiesConsExtended working hours
Good to start here and obtain experience out of college.  Managers and team leaders aren't always the quality you'd expect in this culture.  Limited growth potential if you are at a client location. Team lead at my location was lacking in basic leadership skills.  He often ran a very thin line between being completely incompetent and inappropriate.
ProsUsed to have free lunches, great benefitsConslack of growth.
Great benefits. Bad management. No work life balance. Stressful job. Management has favoritism. Management doesn’t know about the job of their employees.
I enjoyed my stay there, I was able to grow as an employee. The base pay and benefits are good. Also the facilities are good too. I would recommend accenture
ProsFree coffee, salary, paid OT and leavesConsNone
Great place to work. The company offers flexibility and treats their employees like a  human being and not just a number. I have had a good experience working here 
The overall work is okay, the pay is decent but barely enough to get by in a bustling city. I would recommend taking any time off for yourself when you can, because it's super easy to get burnt out.
ProsFree food in some offices based on the clientConsPay is just okay for the area
Case exposure is good and varied and also supportive of one's individual goals. The team is very supportive and understanding. The work hours are good.
The job will vary greatly depending on the company so the impression I got from Accenture was limited. I like that their HR and IT department is easy to contact and they treat you like a customer. Management is supportive, and you do feel cared about. If a contract ends for any reason they'll try their best to place you elsewhere.
It was a great experience working there. I learned something new every day. I was able to use past experience and learn new ones along the way. You can advance and move around to learn more in the company. 
ProsGreat people and environment.ConsDays can be long sometimes.
Very good company for individuals who just started their career , but after staying for a couple of years you'll eventually notice that you just keep on doing the same work over and over again and no sign of promotion or career advancement.
ProsStress-free work, Work-life balance, BonusesConsSlow career advancement
As you go from client to client, you learn a lot about the different work environments, different approaches to tech, new tech that you haven't used before, and overall a diverse experience in terms of day to day operations. They provide a lot of training and certification help and challenge you to improve your skills. They encourage you to learn and grow and as long as you do honest work and represent the company well at client sites, you'll get a decent raise and bonus at the end of the year.Once you start getting into management and want to move up higher, it seems you have to do more than just doing well at the client site. You have to do more in terms of improving the company internally like hosting learning session, writing blogs, participating in side projects (which are actually really cool), etc. This could be a drawback or a benefit depending on what you like, but it could result in working more than a standard 40 hour work week. 
ProsChallenges and encourages you to improve, Diverse work experience, Awesome performance bonuses and raises, Decent work/life balance, Ownership of your careerConsHave to do extra to move up past a senior engineer level, Must always be cognizant of client perception, huge company can make you feel like a fish in the ocean, diverse work experience can be a con too
decent job pretty easy not much advancement potential and the constant surveys from corprate were kind of annoying i did get some help from my superior to help out a team i was interested in 
Cool place to work! Awesome work family. Give great gifts & care about the employees. Sometimes the work can be overwhelming, but team leaders find ways to make it run smoother.
Best company I ever worked for. I work with a team of proactive, intelligent, fun and great human beings. Management and leadership are always attentive to their employees. Great relationship with clients. 
ProsBonusesConsComplex system for career growth
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Company rocks, they do try to do things the good way, at least when I started(about 8 years ago), but lately they been taking some actions which crashes with original culture.
ProsWorking remotely due to pandemicConsWhen you are not assigned to a project they take long to assigned you to a new one.
It seems good intially but kater it is not that gokd, poor management, poor hike, everything is poor here, wveryone is leaving the company not good no good team members
management prioritizes onshore clients. always says yes even tho the employees are already overwhelmed with so many workloads. they time your processes and sometimes that's not accurate because every case is different. they don't pay the employees well.
Learned a new technology framework and did so under a fairly well developed SDLC process. Opportunities to move around company are there. Projects vary. 
ProsGreat place to learn.ConsInitial pay low.
This is a great company for kids straight out of college. Great way to quickly build connections. Workload really depends on your project and client. I know people who work all of three hours a week whereas my projects have consistently taken upwards of 11-12 hours a day. 
ProsOffice events, Espp, clear promotion hierarchyConsQuestionable work life balance
Leadership treats new experienced hires poorly. So called career counselors are rude and quickly put one on an island. Immediate manipulation and game playing environment. Worst mistake of my career.
ProsBenefits and Pay are goodConsToxic culture, disingenuous interactions, manipulative behavior
Pay is not competitive, however if you need a starter job to put on your resume its not a bad starting point. The job security is nice, in my experience it takes a lot to get someone fired, however, you are unlikely to advance in your career within this company. Your experience will be entirely dependent on your management. I have experienced some of the best and some of the worst managers while at Accenture so it can be a toss up. Most people get hired with a referral, and the management can play favorites a lot.
ProsGood insuranceConsNo room for advancement
They pay you well and you learn a lot, but kiss your family goodbye for months at a time. Great place to start before you have a family, but after that if you have not made it into Management you might want to look elsewhere. 
ProsGood benefits, decent PTO bank.ConsUsing that PTO and not getting forever behind...
I really love Accenture. Great place to grow as a consultant no matter what level you are at. Learning iterative methodologies is great, and it helps to be among those practicing them!On the bad side - it is very siloed. You will be in a region typically and if you are not working in that region they will try to pull you back. Even if that means leaving a role you like for one that is not a good fit.
ProsPlenty of PTO, supportive colleagues, excellent mentorsConsClients can overwork you, you may get pulled off good assignments to meet some leaders numbers
I was in training for three weeks with no credentials so I was not able to get paid until a month after I started to work. And then when I brought it up to the managers they fired me.
I had a solid 3 year tenure at Accenture Federal Services. They have a lot of contracts with many roles. The biggest downside is the below market pay as an entry-level analyst. 
ProsBenefits, diverse workforceConsEntry level pay
Had a team lead that definitely cared for all of us. Seemed like the upper level of management didn’t care as much and just wanted us to meet requirements for the day with no excuses. 
I work within accenture strategy and I do not at all recommend it. You have to network to get staffed on projects and you are evaluated based on the percent of time that you are on staffable work, but it's hard to get staffed on things that you care about. Leadership doesn't care about people either
I really learned a lot working for ACN.BAD -- sometimes a lot of pressure and not balanced workload GOOD -- training possibilitiesbenefits Sometimes the advancement steps since are defined are too strict 
This is an excellent company for those driven to work above all else.  This is paid back in generous bonus, benefits, and salary.  The management is very supportive, but agressive timelines make projects intense
ProsExcellent pay and vacation timeConsLong days and weekend work
Smart people, lots of red tape and approvals needed to make any change. hard to move up without open roles. push to outsource most internal functions. 
ProsflexibilityConsso big now, hard to feel like you make a real impact to anything
While there are great people in some areas within Accenture, it is not always easy to find them... You will be given opportunities for advancement so long as you play the game well, but sometimes the hoops and hurdles feel a little silly, especially at the junior levels. This improves somewhat as you move up, and the focus shifts more to political and social connections. The pay is solid, but could be better, typically Accenture is slow to raise pay (relative to market) and quick to cut when times are tough. 
ProsSome great colleagues, good pay, you learn a lot very quicklyConsCan be hard to link up with good people, changing nature of work can make it difficult to maintain quality contacts with the good people
Good company to work for. Best service based company in the industry. Most employee friendly company. Feel free to join it.Best company to work in. Please join and be happy.
ProsFlexible, free transport, wfh, good yearly hikesConsCompensation is slight low
There's lots of changes while working at Accenture. You will most likely be on a different client project every 3 months. If you like constant change this is the place for you. There are endless trainings and documents for you to upskill and learn. There is no hand holding and your career depends all on you. This can be good for some people and absolutely tragic for others.
ProsTraining, Entry Level New Grad PayConsShort-term projects, constant change, management can be hit or miss, promotion process very political
I actually enjoy my job so much. So much overtime available. Management is wonderful, great communication & dedication. Very chill environment as long as you communicate and do your job you are good. Nobody is breathing down your back. It’s a great company and I plan to go far here !
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
What you think you are getting into is not what the job is. To compare it to retail, it is called bait and switch. I did not learn anything at Accenture. Culture was cold. Hardest part of the job was trying to get someone to help you. I did not enjoy the job at all. 
ProsNo ProsConsNo one wants to do the right thing at Accenture.
The team I worked with was absolutely amazing. The contract was extended and additional month. Was to be extended until 08/2021 and sadly I was cut short. I appreciate the time spent with Accenture and hope to work for them again in the future :)
ProsPay, work life balance, my teamConsUnclear reasons for separation
Biased against people who choose not to take an experimental vaccine; they are identifying and plan to make individual contact? WTF.....I liked Accenture until this happened. Now I can barely work I'm so upset by this. Leadership needs to fix this situation which is upsetting for many employees:( Very nice people and good working environment at Accenture besides this latest ploy to steal our freedoms. 
ProsFlexibility, balanceConsInvasion into private health informartion
Nice pay, good working environment, good salary, good work life balance nice management and co-workers. The manager is always available when you need help 
ProsGood payConsVery busy
Accenture is awesome to work for!  Management is awesome!  They are very engaged with employees and the benefits are great!  I love working remote, and they supply the equipment.
The company values and encourages the new idea coming from anyone.If you enjoy the learning everyday then this is place. No doubt you have to spend more time at work due to more client focused work.
ProsAmple of opportunities to upgrade your skillsConsPromotion can be longer process
Low salaries. really bad management and overall bad experience, this job is for someone who can get kicked and pushed all the time, please think twice before applying for this job.
ProsGood colleagues
A great place to start your career and build connections, but the work load and hours can be overwhelming. That said, it will look good on your resume and help you land a less crazy job. 
Incredibly difficult for a minority to receive a promotion. The favorites seem to be the ones who get promoted. While I was with Accenture, I saw far too many quality employees leave the company. They changed their business model in 2018 unfortunately no one knows or understands what that new model is. It was called “Truly Human” but very few of their employees went through the training and therefore don’t understand it. 
ProsAbility to work from homeConsHorrible work life balance
This job was a scam. They “train” you  for 2 weeks, but give you no real info or knowledge that you will actually use on a day to day basis. Management is absolutely ridiculous. Call avoidance is the only thing they know how to do, and blame it on “having the same access” as CSR’s. Their systems work terrible, but then blame you for being in system issues for several minutes at a time. Take any other job besides this one. No PTO, no paid holidays, schedules aren’t great, and the pay isn’t worth getting treated terribly. Spare your mental health/happiness. 
Pros1 hr lunchConsEverything about the job
Great place to work. Very supportive environment. Lots of growth opportunities and ways to move up in the business. DEI is a massive +. Great culture 
ProsDei, events, hoursConsTeam dependent for experience
Definitely not a careerVery poor pay, benefitsMajor favoritism Lower level or tiers tend to know more than managersNo growth opportunities Proceed with caution 
ProsFree snacksConsPay, benefits, management
Good team management i got to work. Guys were supportive. Mostly its depends upon the team you getting at there. Actually nice experience I had at Accenture.
The pros: Interesting work much of the time, smart people, clear progression pathThe cons: Some projects will not align with your interests and you just have to suck it up and deliver. Wages are below par compared to industry until you reach very senior levels. Work life balance is a challenge as it is in many consulting services. 
Great place to work if you value innovation and continued learning. Lots to learn and the company almost expects you to get certifications depending on where you aligned to.
ProsMediocore Healthcare
Fulfilling if you take charge of your roles.Individual offices may be limited in roles offered.Willingness to travel opens up more opportunities.Networking makes getting new roles easier.
Accenture is very aggresive into working. I have leant a lot during my tenure in Accenture. Accenture has lot of projects and all can fit into the role and work of the projects.
ProsLot could be learned.ConsToo much work
Coworkers were very helpful with each other  and team leads had no problem teaching if you weren't clear on something. It was remote  and the pay was great, considering the duties. 
ProsFriendlyConsThe 11- 8 hrs
I was extremely impressed with the level of trust they give their employees. Leadership was available when needed but there was no micromanaging. As long as you communicate they work with you to ensure you have a great work life balance. The project I was on was a bit emotionally draining but I felt supported every single day. There was plenty of opportunity for advancement. 
ProsFree meals, daily mental/screen breaks, diverse, great cultureConsNo overtime
I work remotely from home on eastern time and I still enjoy my job having a passion to help others with empathy and active listening and having patience. I love my job
ProsEverything about the position is goodConsA contractor temporary assignment
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
Good: The pay, good benefits, don't work weekends. Bad: lack of communication, favoritism, horrible management. This company is horrible. You will only move forward if you're close friends to management. They say that mental and physical health is important but if you miss one day because you are really ill, you get disciplined. Management doesn't care if others do their jobs right, doesn't communicate anything to their employees, and they don't care about their employees. If you want to be paid decently but treated horribly, then this is the place for you!
ProsGood pay, 1 hr lunchConsLack of communication, favoritism, no PTO or sick leave, No holiday pay
"I've been with Accenture for a few years now and have seen change for better and for worse.  Benefits are better than average (but that's not surprising for a large corporation) including an adoption stipend and fertility coverage under the medical plans in the US. Within my group, WLB is hit or miss depending upon you project alignment to the point where I've worked 80+ hours or 30 hours in a week. Travel is minimal for my role, maybe 1-2 times annually. The best part is the people, though. Corny, I know, but true. I've made true friends here and have learned more than I thought I could from some incredible professionals. On that note, the bad...Compensation is lacking and there's zero transparency on salary ranges by level. I came in to the company on a lowball offer (silly me) and haven't yet achieved the wages of some of my peers despite positive annual reviews and consistent plus ones. Worse, there is still blatant gender wage disparity despite senior management's touting equality. Promotions only happen if the business has a need for your level and role which is disheartening to those of us who are consistent high performers but not sitting with the ""right"" group. Overall, I continue to stay with the company because I love my colleagues, but I'm not a lifer. "
ProsBenefits, ColleguesConsCompensation, Promotions
It’s a great company to work for, but everyone is ready to stab you in the back at a moments notice, and then the whole thing feels like a mirage. The people are lovely and you’ll like them, but it’s all a front. And their real business is outsourcing the jobs of America, a tune to 20B$ a year. Check your soul at the door 
ProsNice peopleConsThey’re fake nice and secretly everyone is out for themselves
Depends on what project you are put on on, but the one I was on had high turnover with management that was incompetent and detached.  It's difficult to change projects and management actually makes it difficult for you to leave the project.Had I been placed on another project, my experience may have been completely different, but unfortunately you are assigned to a project after you are hired instead of during the interview process, so you really don't have any idea what the job will be like. 
ProsSmart colleaguesConsClueless management, high turnover, assigning people to projects after hiring
They will let you self train and at a self pace, ONLY when they have no work to do. Most of the work I had to learn was about Artificial Intelligence, Block chain, Data, Security, Dev Ops, Agile Solutions, all of which had no bearing on my role as a Recruiter.
ProsSet hoursConsToo many unnecessary meetings.
Accenture charges about 2-3 times more than a typical tech consulting company. It leads to high expectations from the Client. We are always under the gun.
ProsLittle bit more money than a typical tech consulting companyConsWay too many to list.
The company is good, supportive, and inclusive.  I would say that pay is lower than other companies for Developers and the promotion system needs some improvement, but that is something that they seem to be changing over time.
Good for new graduates, chances to try many different projectsWork life balance is difficult to achieve. Your career growth depends heavily on the projects and connections you made
I am working for last 7 years as application development and management. Lots of tech stack to learn and expose. Only problem is based on project the appraisal will be good or bad.
ProsFree cab, good work culture, job security, growthConsLow to medium salary, work pressure
Work till 12a or longer with little to no recognition of extra hours or hard work to meet deadline.  I often did the work of 3 people but when deadlines were missed it was our fault. 
I’m the begging you would feel great and happy working there but in time you realize it is very stressful environment not because of the work itself, it’s because the management they make it very stressful place to be successful.
ProsThe job it’s easyConsToo much micromanagement, miscommunication, not enough opportunities for growth
The company provides great opportunity to experience a wide range of projects and industries. The company is very diverse and working with hot topics such as cloud
Work environment is good but every minute is monitored and lots of work load. overtime is require most of the time even working on a Saturday is required but paid. Overall work experience is good 
ProsYou will learn a lotConsToo much work load
I enjoyed working for my client, but oftentimes, you feel more drawn to the work your client is doing than the work your company (in this case, Accenture) is doing.   It is what it is, but as a consultant, if you get emotionally invested in the work for your client, you will feel a sense of not belonging to either your current company nor your client.....both feel like you're being kept at arms distance.My current project has people regularly working 10-15 hour days and weekends with no reprieve, despite alerting management to feelings of burnout.  Management talks the talk, but doesn't walk the walk when it comes to helping people manage their workload.
ProsPay is decentConsWork/life balance, culture.
It is a good company to work for. The work life balance is really great. But compensation is on the lower end for requiring an engineering degree. Not many positions to advance your career. 
It was a tiring but fun experience. It brings out the best in me and I realize that even though I am a person with disability, I can still work in corporate industry. I wish I was given a longer time working with them because I enjoyed my work with Accenture a lot. I know I have a lot to contribute specially in terms of process improvement.
Proswork fromhome set-up.Consthe scorecard is the same for all, I am a person with disability, score card should be different from those without disability.
I worked for Accenture through a staffing agency and I was “Onboarding” since March 2021 it is now May 2021 and I have not been paid since April 2021 very unorganized very unprofessional I have 4 weeks of pending timecards I never actually got put into training for project hope. 
ProsGood peopleConsNOt being paid for 4 weeks
Well run company, work with smart people, learn skills to take elsewhere. They invest in employees and compensation is good. Would recommend to friends. 
The best company if you're looking for long term career. Have a lot of trainings and career development programs. Company outing and other corporate social responsibilities.
ProsGood company cultureConsnone
Great company, a little high on the corporate koolaid but other than that it was a great place to work. Pays well. Great benefits. Lots of PTO. No complaints. 
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
The company is filled with lobby. If you are part of the lobby, things will go smooth & you can achieve your career goals way easily than expected. The company have a vision but hired a bunch of insane people who can make your life miserable. If you have a competing offer, don't bother to turn back !! This company will not recognize your value until you resign.
ProsJob SecurityConsManagement
This would be the perfect company to work with, I'm just happy to be here. Maybe the cons would be the HR, management and all of the problems with human interactions with leaders, but it's all okay 
Cog in the machine - you become a number. I would not recommend at all - go find a more meaningful place to work. It will be worth it. Trust me. Go be a human not a cog. 
Spanish Speakers get paid Less than any other language, other languages like Portuguese or Arabic get Paid $2 more but still expect you to answer inquiries in other languages. UNEQUAL PAY 
ProsdiverseConslow pay, discrimination
Accenture is a metorious company so it is important that you aligned with real leaders who are part of the culture and not above it in order to have individual success. They so network but that is just words!
ProsPay and bonus planConsGood ole boy mentally that is overt!
great place tonwork, management is always there with an open door policy, your concerns are taken to heart and they try to find resolutions quickly and efficiently
Good and fun placeNot so interesting projectsDecent work life balanceNice team outingsGood facilities like gym,cafetaria,cab etc..Supporting managers
Too much internal competition, politics, and clicky management.Worked here for 15+ years, seen company changes 5 times over. The people is what makes me stay here. 
ProsTalented people, teamwork, knowledgeable resources.ConsToo much internal competition, politics, and clicky management.
The projects I was assigned to were truly interesting, but the management has a very weak culture and don't support the well being of the employes.Everyone was complaining about the low salary
Leadership cares more about being woke than running a profitable company.  Constant hectoring emails from Leadership forcing their leftist politics on employees.I for one do not care about the politics that one espouses, and I feel that a company that values diversity should understand that people do not like to have a point of view forced upon them.
ProsCompensation is fairConsLittle regard is given to aligning work to your skillset, It is hard to have a 100% allocation to any project, Constantly get thrown into problem situations with very little notice.
An okay place to work to gain experience after university but not many progression opportunities to succeed further in the company. It has a good work/life balance and some nice perks.
ProsFree lunch, healthcareConsNo bonuses, incentives
I have worked for 9 years. Both teams I worked with Finance and HR V&A were amazing. People were very kind and I had a lot of growth. Pay is not the best but has good benefits.
ProsBenefits, work from home, people, flexibilityConsWorkload, lot of trainings sometimes make it harder
Accenture provides excellent employee benefits such as healthcare, life insurance, additional allowances and incredible incentives and bonuses. There are wide selections of projects and departments you can transfer to for your professional growth. The culture is superb and management are very supportive.
ProsBonuses, Culture, Work life balance, Management, BenefitsConsNone
Great place to work.  Almost everyone you work with is very talented and professional. Good variety of work as well.  My biggest complaint would be that they sometimes don’t manage your career very well.  They have me like a jack of all trades so I’m not heavily specialized.  When I approached a senior manager about this I was told that being a generalist wasn’t bad,  that the pendulum was always swinging between specialists and generalists 
People you work with are great. Diverse range of expertise and talent. However, you do have to look after yourselves and tap into the expertise and talents of the individuals you work with. Otherwise, you will not thrive. 
Great company to join great benefits and opportunities. You will learn a lot for the business vision and cutting edge technology. I highly recommend you take a CB look and worth for serious consideration. 
This is  a great company to work for. Accenture offers you opportunities for personal growth; training, support and mentorshipManagement is always there for you, listen and provide you with feedback whenever needed
ProsflexibilityConsn/a
Plenty of projects - can range (most of mine have been largely unsatisfying)Performance reviews are almost non-existent.Engineers arent as visible as the consultants
ProsAlot of projects
A lot of diversity in the job, they will help develop and are very open to new ideas. Might be difficult to keep worklife balance, espacially durinr COVID, even if management is really trying its best. 
ProsTeamsConsCovid
Great experience.  Cannot recommend them enough.  Much like the military experience, you come out better than you started.They will improve your capabilities and career.
ProsGreat OrganizationConsThere are some meat heads and fashionistas that don't focus on the task at hand.
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
No matter you have skills and knowledge about the process and may be good at Keeping the Things well. But end of the day you have to praise the manager to get our promotions to be happened.
ProsJob secuirityConsNo value for complete skilled person and compensation also very less
Accenture is a great company to work for. There are so many different positions and opportunities to grow. They also have great benefits and opportunities to improve.
Management is always straight forward in regards to setting attainable goals and always supportive. The work is fair and there is always support available.
ProsGreat pay, working conditions.ConsNone
I've really enjoyed by time as a management consultant at Accenture. The work is challenging and the exposure to large clients is a major plus. You do have to be mindful of steering your own career path here, however. 
So far so good. they look after you, but there could be more room for improvement on the advancement and promotions. currently working from home so it's hard to communicate and be personable with the team. 
Prosfree lunches
My seven years were outstanding but as I started at age 56 I was not looking for advancement as much as job security and intellectual challenge which I got.
ProsSmart coworkers.ConsConstant vying for roles every 6 months.
A lot of misinformation regarding the different career tracks and what they mean for you and your growth with the company. Good team and culture, but poor management of performance and promotions.
Was uploading applications but now taking incoming calls. How to use new programs. I feel that the management team is not listening to issues and concerns that employees are having, take to long to respond. I work from home which is nice. The job is not hard. Helping clients get application in on time is very rewarding to me.
ProsPay check.ConsHealthcare?
Nice company to work with, totally depends on which project you get. Sometimes management will not notice you if you are only working for the client..
Demanding environment that has big reward payoffs in career exploration and career advancement.  The company has many opportunities to engage with smaller communities with shared interest which lends itself to being a part of a shared collective community within the larger company environment.
Prosgreat company for career exploration and career advancementConssometimes work / life balance is off kilter
I know that's sort of a cop out, but it's true in cases where you work for a enormous company like Accenture.  It depends on which project you're on, who you know, and who will support you in your career.  It's very niche, but if you can find the right one, then you'll be very successful.  Otherwise it's easy to be just a cog in a wheel and not feel like you're working towards anything meaningful.  I think overall it's a good place to work at just to gain experience.  Whether you stay long term or not will depend on what I mentioned before.
Compensation and benefits are fantastic. Work/life balance is hit or miss. You earn a healthy amount of PTO but many times can not get the time off so can potentially lose it. In management days are very long. It is also questionable how effective a manager you can be for your people when your team can number more than 50. Like most companies these days they overkill pushing political views and inclusion and diversity training.  There is a lot of opportunity to build knowledge and skills but at times the amount of “encouraged” trainings can be overwhelming to the point of affecting your ability to do the job you’re paid to do.  Every time a client contract ends you must seek and interview for a new role. Maybe I am old school but I feel once you are hired by a company you should have a job and not have the added stress of being unemployed every few months/years. If you enjoy a lot of change or are a ladder climber you can do well. If you want to just do the best job that you can with longevity until retirement you may end up elsewhere. 
ProsCompensation, benefitsConsLittle job security, inconsistent work/life balance
Great place to learn new things through their knowledge portal. Management team is not very supportive in placements on new projects for employees reporting to them. You have to be very proactive and well connected in order to stay continuously on projects.
ProsWork from home flexibility, Great Learning OpportunitiesConsVery minimal support from management team and managing directors, Placements are based on how well you are connected, new experienced hire will have hard time to get placements
Accenture is a place where you can learn a lot of things, but it is also a place that will at times demand you sacrifice your life outside of work. Lots of times this is due to poor management decisions, and often times management will not own up to it.
ProsYou can learn a lotConsLack of respect for personal time
We all worked as a Team to get the job done.  Managers Micro Manage too much. But other than that its a fun place to work. I worked in Billing and Collections. My name went out on the invoices. So I was the main contact to collect the money owed. I would follow-up once a week until I collected the invoice.
ProsFun place to workConsYour micro managed
Accenture offers great learning material and tech industry grooming through online resources, but you have to seek it out for yourself. No one really minds which grunt leads the grunt work, so as long as it gets done.if you're looking for mentorship this is not the place... I can't emphasize that enough. The experience of working at any corporate entry-level position is going to be whatever you make of it at the end of the day. 
ProsClient Roster, Resume Clout, Accesibility to self-learning materialConsManagers demonstrate poor leadership skills, seniority-based promotion standards, and other outdated level structures.
Great place to work. Nothing too negative - but that is very different between projects. It is definitely based on who you know, and not how well you do your job. 
Accenture can be a great place to work, but your experience really depends on your group/leadership and clients. I have had both great and terrible experiences while working for Accenture. Management Consulting in general does not provide great work/life balance and this holds true for Accenture. You will work with very smart people and the salaries are competitive. 
ProsPeople are great. Salary is competitive.ConsWork / Life balance is not great, but that is typical for management consulting
Good place to work, decent management and manager, limited opportunity of the growth. Both side cab, bi-annually bonus, fairly appraisel                                                 
great place to work. interesting people, good culture. great clients that challenged you across different industries and geographies. opportunity to travel.
Good place to start your career, but don't stay too long. You will learn a good amount, work with interesting people, and it will be worth your time. But as soon as you get your experience, leave.
ProsWide scope of work, interesting projectsConsWLB issues, some old-school managers and old-school thinking
If you get the rught project and the right people in the team, you would love the place and the organization. Leads are very supportive and encouraging.
Great experience from day one. Helpful team leads, great managers, and awesome coworkers. Fast pace, but always available for assistance when needed rather a team lead or a seasoned co-worker. Sometimes irrational expectations, coupled with a lack of communication between team lead and management. Overall great company and experience!!!!
ProsFree meals, laid back environment, great benefitsConsLack of communication from management. Sometimes heavy workloads.
I truly enjoyed being at Accenture. Even though sometimes I felt as though they assigned too much work they geniuly care about you and how you're feeling as person.
I love working for this company! They honestly care about their employees and do all they can to ensure you have all of the proper training and equipment to succeed. Everyone is very nice and helpful. The management really strive to give you an adequate work/homelife balance. I 100% recommend working for Accenture!
ProsPaid training, compassionate, great payConsBenefits are lacking a little for contractors
Consulting work has its pros and cons based on the project you're working on and the duration. Does give you opportunity to pick up new skills and to work on different projects but you do sometimes need to have strong networking to make those connections.
Accenture is very good up to team lead level w.r.t job security ..Hikes are very good.Culture is very good and depends on project.Clients also very good.
I worked at Accenture during summer as a digital marketing analyst and I must say that I hat the fact that they hire contractors. It's really just corporate America not wanting to pay proper saleirs and benefits and the government does nothing about it.
Really differs based on role and practice, but working with Accenture Strategy requires hard work. There is often lack of work life balance especially given COVID-19.. Pay is great compared to industry but maybe less so compared to MBB, LEK, etc.
ProsMoneyConsWork life balance
Training is long but thorough. There are many resources to help you after training as well. The goals and expectations are clear cut from the beginning and are relayed to the team in a timely manner.
Accenture is a good company with a lot of capability - if you have a large digitally driven need and need a lot of help solving it - Accenture is a top choice.  Personal experience was not as positive.  Original recruiting was more to develop new product and solutions.  Turned in to straight revenue generation role.  Some groups had relatively positive culture, some groups that were more revenue only focused had a more traditional rough sales language culture that was not attractive or motivating.
ProsHighly capable organization - technology savvyConsUp and down internal culture - leadership promoted one more positive culture, but groups exist with essentially the opposite culture
Great benefits (PTO, health care, stock options)Great for those who want to travel oftenWhen you find the right people, you can learn a lotA typical day was 8/9am to 5pm and some work on weekends if we were deploying e-commerce platforms
I was hired as an intern and really enjoyed my time there. I learned a lot and they gave me opportunities to travel too. I had the opportunity to work from home too. 
Very large organisation. Could be better managed. Diverse and meaningful projects but you have to really appease a lot of people to get good projects. 
ProsDiversity of work. Opportunities to relocate, Good healthcare a d Pension benefitsConsCould be better managed. Lot of office politics
I have had several jobs over the years and this has been by far the worst. They lied during my interview about pay, career advancement, etc and they will lie to you! There isn’t enough pay in this world to get me to deal with half of the mess I dealt with. Management is clueless and has zero clue how to lead. Training was extremely fast and pushy! If you don’t learn fast, this isn’t the job for you! My entire team didn’t feel comfortable completing the work after training and we expressed that we needed more time, but management did not care about our concerns. Everyone would get emails stating, “if you can’t be faster at processing, then we will get rid of you!” That is not how you treat employees! I will never recommend this company to anyone!! With this company it is QUANTITY over QUALITY!! Applicants beware!!! 
ProsRemoteConsMicromanaging, demanding, quantity over quality
I have worked for about 2 years, there is a lot of competition between managers to get their own people recognized so at the end it feels like several groups with a internal cold war between them
ProsNice extrasConsDepends on customer but if you are the contractor
Not amazing and not the worst place to work. Will have choice over projects during a limited time period. Otherwise will be told to be on any random project.
ProsVariety of projects to choose fromConsLow career progression
Good pay, good work/life balance, nothing too crazy. Really good benefits. Lots of opportunities for professional development through training programs
Great people at all levels of the company. Compensation is lacking for the NYC metro area on the senior analyst level (Tech - Java). However there is room for progression.
My favorite part of the job was that every day was completely different. I might be working on rolling out a new initiative in the morning and in the afternoon succession planning for leadership.
Life/ work balance is good. It is not good at performance review. I would say it is one of worst companies that I have experienced. Many layers of management do not promote to get things done effectively. You will be evaluated by the work that you have done.
