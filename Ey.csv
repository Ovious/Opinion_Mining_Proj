Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
Overall my time at EY was pretty great. The coworkers and support system is awesome and although consulting is a heavy workload, they do their best to give you work life balance. Only area for improvement is some flexibility in choosing your project when multiple options are available. 
The firm is full of interesting and smart individuals. There is some variation in how much they're willing to help you but, overall, must people enjoy teaching their team members. It was a great place to start my career.
ConsPay could be better early in career
There is a huge shortage of employees in almost all fields. Turnover is high. This means that there is always way more work than people to perform the work. 
Started a career at EY since my graduation. Was able to see a number of different countries through business travels, and had learnt a lot. Pay is lower than industry until you progress through the ranks. 
ProsLots to learn, inclusive teamsConsHours can be long, Projects can feel repetitive after a while, Pay can feel low
really enjoyed the company of everyone on my team. a lot of smart, down to earth people who became good friends. hours are really dependent on your engagement. pay was excellent
For beginning is good, but workload is enormous. No work-life balance, always under pressure and stress. As you will deal with different projects and tasks, you will receive great experience 
I had a great mentor and was able to advance in my career because of the mentor + management. The work culture was also really great, and I felt immersed in the company.

Busy season sucks. The people I worked with were great and really tried to help me understand the information/processes.  It’s good for your resume. Good luck!
EY is a great place to be at. It helps you to connect with several people from across the world. You get to work on international assignments and it helps you broaden your perspective.
Overall, working at this company will definitely give you a great sense of achievement. Yes there are long work hours and a lot demanded of you, but it will be a great launch for any career in accounting. 
Good training contract and support for exams including study leave.    Broad range of clients for well rounded experience when starting out in career.
Diverse workplace with flexible work. Lots of opportunity for promotion and also ability to move between departments and industries. If you are a high performer, the firm will definitely take care of you. Great place to begin and grow your career.
Just don't. Management doesn't really care about its employees no matter the surveys. Turnover rate is high. Unlimited vacation is a lie. Flexible vacation is a lie too.

Goede ontwikkel en groeimogelijkheden en een fijne en inclusieve cultuur. Veel ruimte voor eigen inbreng en ideeën.Je moet wel sterk je eigen mening kunnen uiten in een organisatie met veel intellectuele personen. 
401K, health insurance, paid holidays and flexible vacations.Job is very operative but you are learning a lot from different teams. Some certifications are paid by the firm.
Challenging, wonderful learning opportunities and networking!  You gain access to the technical resources and the ability to work in an engaging team.
EY is a very interesting place. On one hand i have alot of opportunity to learn and grow, and managements a within the People Advisory Service are intriguing. The major problem is the tremendous work stress and long hours. My WLB is very unstable, making some weeks I work 30 hours (rarely) and some weeks 65, And anywhere in between. Things change at a drop of a hat. There have been moments when I’m on vacation that I end up having to get work done
ProsPay; work experiencesConsLong hours; very high stress; poor WLB
I would stay away from ey.  Losers. Vc Management talks about empathy as ND mindfulness, but do not understand why as t either means.  Lots of inexperienced, entitled idiots and second rate actors trying to climb try the corporate ladder.  Very negative experience.
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
Had high recognition for a long time. Software was sunsetting and going to web-based that needed less support.  Management used a PIP to justify my layoff b/c I was at a level that did not justify my salary.
Be prepared to work a lot of hours. Training is not the best but there are nice people there. Lots of benefits and resources for employees. High learning curve. 
good place to learn as a beginner. Though there mightt not any guidance from the company, you can put your own effort to learn from wide range of work opportunities you would get here
The hours are long but compressed. Learn a lot in a short time. Your experience will be really formed based on your teams and not really the firm as a whole. Benefits are good but standard for the industry.  
What is the best part of working at the company?The hotel stays.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Hours/demand What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stressful What is a typical day like for you at the company?Stressful with Unclear direction.
Toxic culture with a demanding schedule. Management doesn’t care about employees. Lots of office politics, career sabotaging, etc. Would not recommend working here.
Fantastic company to work for and to grow. Excellent people, fast paced and leading-edge technology opportunities. Multiple project load, solid decision making and decisiveness are critical skills. Compensation in line with industry standards.
ProsFlex timeConsAdvancement can be slow in coming
Great company with great benefits but doesn’t make up for lack of work life balance. Superficial personalities as well when most people were actually miserable. 
busy season is long hours people you work with is important Working sometime upward of 70 hours a week. very strict tight ship. I just am writing words to get to the minimum 
ProscultureConshours
Managers don't care about you at all. Unrealistic 9 minute calls and if calls are more then 9 minutes of talktime then the employee must be doing something wrong. There is no aftercall unavailable time to document calls, There is less then 25 seconds before another call comes in. Corporate Videos display and describe a wonderful experience, but the reality is a total opposite. 
Prospay was Great 25.00 an hourConslack of respect
Long hours and the pay does not compensate. Great place to start as you'll get exposed to various types of work and clients but it will always feel like a busy season.
politics was played everywhere and affected even people at lower level. busy season went on for about half a year not just a few months. expected to work long hours even during non busy season.
I was extremely fortunate to work at E&Y.  While there, I found the work extremely challenging.  I worked long hours, but my work was very satisfying.  The job culture was amazing, and room for advancement was without equal.  I highly recommend E&Y.  
ProsCareer advancement and work satisfaction.ConsLong work hours.
I interned at EY last summer. I was treated very well and assigned a reasonable amount of task. However, I wanted more tech to be involved in my daily job; so I decided to explore other opportunities.
I worked my internship during Covid out of the New York office. It was tough because the internship was remote while I was taking online classes so the work behind the screen seemed grueling without being able to directly bring questions to managers or seniors. Overall it was a great learning experience that shows you just how much work you’ll be doing when you actually start lol 
But job was really stressful sometimes just before the project deadlines. However it was a decent pay and they also offer budget for courses and training 
EY has a very toxic culture. You have to be a favorite of the management to get any assignment/project and advancing your career. It is a constant struggle to get recognized by the management no matter how hard you work. If you are honest and hard working, EY is not a place for the career advancement
tight budget and timeline every time for projects and not enough resource result in team members work overtime always. Salary below market with normal benefits only.   
Great company to work for. Tough to grow if you work in CBS. You are paid in flexibility and benefits rather than actual salary. Fantastic place for a working mom if in CBS but if I were client facing it would be too much. 
Very clear promotion ladder no matter the rank that you are currently at, high performing teams that provide mentorship opportunities, challenging yet rewarding work 
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
Great teammates, good room for growth. A lot of great learnings curated by EY. Most counselors are supportive. Allow flexible working. Good work-life balance in general. 
People have no time for gossip. For determining the good effective hours everyone tries to work effectively therfore a busy day is spent. Employees are integrated with the global teams. Senior, mid and junior staff make their tea on themself. No one can talk to you unprofessionally.
The work culture totally depends on the team that you work with (more often than not bad). The role gives you a lot of oppurtunity to learn and advance however the pay is not great.  
ProsTravel, Diversity of oppurtunitiesConsLow Pay
Great benefit and flexible work place with the option to work from home. Great work life balance but does occasionally get overwhelming. Pay could be much better.
Most people are stressed to the max. The technology is terrible and attrition is a pain. The DSG concept creates a lot of confusion and an internal recruiting environment that doesn’t allow for an account team to repeat and also creates excessively bad politics 
- Work-life balance depends on the project- Opportunities for learning- Management seems to care about employees- Inclusive workplace- Can be discouraging due to low pay compared to similar roles at other companies- The coworkers are nice.
Answer all incoming calls, pick up mail and deliver to correct person. Handle mail machine and help all Admins when needed. Order all office supplies and coffee supplies for the office. Maintain very good relationships with all my vendors. Meet and greet all clients and customers making sure they are helped in a timely matter.
EY has a very dynamic work environment.  It has great people and a great culture.  I learned a lot in my fifteen years there. However, the higher up on the totem pole the better you'll do. There's not a lot of advancement for career opportunities in the administrative roles but there is much advancement in the professional roles such as the accounting and consulting positions. 
ProsExcellent benefitsConsLong hours during busy season
Long hours.   Issues with treatment of diverse employees wrt inclusion and exposure to career-enhancing experiences.  Highly competitive.  Great benefits. 
Depending on your role they use you. It is only about getting revenue numbers up, they do not care about your health. They will make you do repeated tasks if its necessary.
If you're looking for a career in audit/tax for Big Four you should expect competitive pay, better benefits and perks than smaller firms, excellent career progression, but bad work life balance. It's not unlikely for an employee to work multiple busy seasons throughout the year, even outside of the standard 12/31 year end busy season.
ProsTons of experience, competitive pay and scheduled raises/promotions, vast experienceConswork life balance is atrocious.
CBS breeze, client facing depends on service line. Benefits good and people are nice. Watch out for CT like sharks. Lots lifers. Mercury disaster. Good brand
The Good:Professional services - very good, the partners are great at what they do. Great business culture.The Bad:The admin and support depts. function like a gravy train, with inefficient oversight by the  immediate managers and very poor big-picture problem solving by both mid- and upper-level management.The Ugly:Too much political correctness and not enough meritocracy in the administrative and support depts.
I worked as a contractor up until I was hospitalized due to a high risk pregnancy. I would recommend anyone who gets the opportunity to work for them to TAKE IT!
The people you work with are going to be highlight. Everyone is approachable and have decent personalities. The work can get boring but it's also not the hardest. 
So far, I've loved working at EY. At the start of your career, everyone is willing to help and questions are encouraged when you are stuck. If you express interest in a skill/topic on the job, management does their best to find something that will get your toes in the water. 
I worked for EY for about a year in various roles. In my final role, I was struggling to understand the work I was doing and asked for help. I was always told to figure it out on my own. When I finally spoke up to my managers about the lack of support I was being provided I was terminated. I was working 80 hour weeks, dealing with client harassment (without support of management), training myself and learning on the fly. There is no culture at this firm, there is no support, there is no accountability. Avoid this company at all costs. I have heard that I have been put on a do-not-rehire list and any references I have used at other companies have resulted in loss of opportunities. I have been unable to find another job in 8 months thanks to this firm. My career has been destroyed by the Enterprise Risk practice. 
Prossometimes you get to take a lunch breakConspoor management, no work/life balance, under staffed, low pay, no support, will retaliate
great team, friendly, help you grow, treat you like friends, workload heavy during peak season, overall nice place to work, eat lunch together, get reimbursed for transporation.
I have had a great 15 plus years of working at EY. The culture is great and you do have a work life balance. I find the firm to be very progressive in technology and processes across all business practices include internal support roles. It is about as stable of a company as you can find nowadays and if you wok hard and are patient you will advance. 
ProsGreat work life balance, time off and culture.ConsBenefits are competitive at best, pay is competitive to low comparatively speaking.
Seniors will be condenscending when teaching you the job. So have an open mind and be strong willed. Learn as much as you can because there is alot to learn
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
Standard consulting job, everything highly depends on the exact team you are working with and project you are engaged. It might be a very big difference between people on 1 grade .
As a new accountant, the responsibility and training provided were top notch.  Lots of opportunities to network.  Supplies room was ample with everything you needed for jobs.  
ProsTravel and networking
Work-life balance is horrible and for such little pay. Working 12-plus hour days sometimes having to work weekends as well during peak season. Overall an okay experience.
Proswellness fundConsover worked, unpaid and hard to take off
Need to work on better work life balance.  Salary not as competitive as the other big4.Work from home is a nice benefit.  The have a few other perks that are nice
ProsWork from homeConsWork life balance
Thought it was interesting. Joined as an intern. Given enormous resource and was looking to gain added experience. Overall wondering where placement takes place
Great place to start but not a good place to stay long term if you don't wish to be a partner/principal or anything near it. EA role has very little room for growth. You will have to start from bottom and do a lot of extra certification you may not have time for. Timeline for growth is too long. Great benefits and network.
Prosbenefits, unlimited vacation when you can use itConsoverworked, underpaid
While it was great experience, the hours and the management was not it. I had to cancel vacations last minute and was never apologized to. Work life balance was 0.
I always felt like my work had a clear sense of purpose at EY (strategy and transactions). The work was enjoyable and my colleagues were a pleasure to work with. However, workloads were large (which is to be expected) and often ultimately at unsustainable levels. Partners are very focused on winning more work despite knowing their is insufficient resource to do it. 
ProsGood teams, quick progressionConsUnrealistic workloads
Great place for newly minted grads and those early in accounting careers. The big 4 brand goes a very long way in the profession. Good luck & stay positive!
Worked in a niche tech group and work was pretty disorganized. Too many PMs just billing hours but I don't see what work they're doing. Also too much politics
Lots of hours during busy season, and teams are typically understaffed unfortunately. However, there are lots of learning opportunities and you get exposure to a lot of different things. 
ProsYearly promotionsConspay isn't great, hours aren't great
I think EY could increase their wages and reward hard working employees with salary bonuses more often Other than that, the company is phenomenal to work for. 
What is the best part of working at the company?Good organizationa and seems to care for their employeesWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Lack of advancement opportunities unless you are on track to become a partnerWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Fairly friendly and easy-going
Working at EY is typical consulting. Long hours.  Client annoyances and toxic managers. Out of the big four, they pay the least, but claim to be the leaders in compensation.  The benefits are very good and a lot of holidays and vacation if you can get them. 
What is the best part of working at the company?Flexibility What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Expectations and hours
Very stressful work. The company cares only for margin and there is no focus on employees. The busy season can be really hard to go through (>60 h X week in the wrong team). 
Great place to build a career, amazing benefits, pay is decent. OK 401K match. Unlimited PTO. They have gympass now and 1k for wellness reimbursement.
Over the past eight weeks, I have had the unique opportunity to intern at one of the most established and successful accounting firms in the country. Entering as a Launch Intern for Ernst & Young (EY) allowed me the ability to rotate between two service lines and gain valuable knowledge of the tax and consulting industries. During my time, I received insight into the environment EY cultivates and the opportunity for both personal and career growth.
Good place to start your career, a lot of opportunities to learn, good people to work with, but with a lot of pressure and working hours. Overall an average place to work at
Good place to work for a few years but moving up post Manager role is very challenging. Becomes more about visibility within your large team rather than great work being done at the client or for the firm. 
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
I have been working at ey for under a year and I have not enjoyed one minute of it. Firstly, when I was hired I was told that my salary was nonnegotiable which I later found out was a lie from colleagues who were hired. When you are first hired they will make it seem like you are in control of your career and that you have flexibility to work on multiple different engagements that will benefit your career, that is not true at all. If you are not on a project, your experience manager will pressure you to get on a project, regardless of if it has anything to do with your previous experience or interests. I think most of this stems from the experience managers not knowing about what the different engagements actually entail. I have had various conversations with the experience managers and they literally have no idea of the certifications that I hold or the experience that I have, which doesn’t make sense considering the fact that they determine which project you should be assigned to. The culture at ey sucks, managers have this idea that they can use the staff as they please and pretty much assign any task to you. When you are assigned to a project as a staff or senior staff you don’t get assigned a specified set of tasks, you are pretty much there to do whatever the manager tells you to. This is unfair because there is no limit on what is right and wrong. I literally have had managers tell me to lie, and do things that I was completely uncomfortable doing. The funny thing is, your success and promotional opportunities are solely based on the subjective feedback that is provided - more...
It depends on your team honestly. Somedays are longer than others and some team members are nicer than others. Some members on my team have been quite toxic however.
Well intended bunch of folks but the consulting model isn't for me. Staff do all the work, no one has time to mentor, and leadership is too busy selling services we can't adequately or ethically staff.
ProsHigher pay, flexibility on work locationConsAbsent leadership, lip service, greed
Works very hard. i mean, very very hard during the season. Mentally and physically prepare yourself. Get used to take out dinners (and lunches and breakfast)
They can do better with their benefits. Compensation is not fair for the amount of work we do. Busy season is crazy but better than other big 4. Vision care isn’t that great which I think can be better since most of us wear glasses 
You work really long hours, but you learn a lot on the job quickly. Busy season is brutal but there's a little more flexibility outside of busy season. 
Good place to work and gain experience. The internship was a great learning opportunity and I would do it again. EY has great culture and they want to see you succeed.
The work life balance is very poor depending on what team/product you are working on. Client needs/demands are priority, no matter how last minute they can be.
ConsWork life balance, low morale, disconnection
you will learn a lot under high stress. A great stepping stone for your career but you won't have much life. workplace culture is ok. the hardest part of the job is you have to juggle everyday
Proslearning curveConslife sucks
Don’t expect much in terms of a life or caring management at this company. After doing busy seasons they market time off for education or vacations. That’s all a lie. You are at the needs of the company always.
Benefits and pay are good for a 9-5 job, but expectation is to be constantly on call and working at least 60 hours a week is the standard.Huge focus and culture of climbing corporate ladder and thinking about next promotion rather than collaborative team focus towards goals.  
ProsGood people and standard of clientConsBenefits, work life balance.
My time at EY was great.  If I can go back, I would.  It's a great place to learn.  I had a mentor who I trusted and she trusted me.  I walked away learning so much, not just from her but from other managers as well.Also a great place to start out from college.
ProsA lot of great things to learnConscan't think of any....
Great place and flexible environment. Learned a lot while working there and was challenged and fulfilled by coworkers. Great communication and teamwork. 
The pay is good.FSO tax: Busy season has seemingly been nonstop.  Turnover has been ridiculous to the point of acting as my own staff/senior/manager.
ProsPayConsNo wlb
Early career advancement and education are fantastic. Great teams, great culture. The apprentice model of learning is very much maintained. Certain offices focus on development of individuals more than others. 
Assurance practice has typical busy season. With that being said, if you have the time to invest early for a CPA and establishing contacts, you will prosper. Do not forsake your mental health and communicate with your teams to ensure you're not overworked and you will thrive. 
I happened to find out about certain changes in New York office. There has been communication issue as far as working culture ,leadership and ownership of the company.I don’t have an elaborate report of company and employee whereabouts. I managed to reach name and reputation in New York office that I am not able to receive.
I left banking to join EY consulting so I could have multiple experiences transforming businesses and seeing how they work. They quickly siloed me into technology work I didn't want to do, but fortunately I had some great managers who made it worth while. They will push you to get client work done and do proposals all at the same time while the partner makes a ton of money and you're left underpaid. Overall its a great place to get some great experience on your resume but not for the long haul unless you feel like sucking up to get ahead.
ProsWellness stipends, manager and above monetary gifts for good work, great experience, professional deck makersConsover worked, to much on your plate, not much care for you from the top
Don't do it. During my time at EY they did not recognize non-accounting-related credentials. EY views their employees as either long-term or industry hires; where industry hires are experienced persons incorporated from the field. Thus, unless you are an Accountant (or a related profession) then from a sociopolitical perspective, you are a second-class employee. Also, despite the array of service areas within EY, employees don't have the flexibility to choose to work in areas of the business that best aligns with their background. Instead, employees are limited to the strict control of their Supervisor who may not have the employee's best interest in mind.
You will learn a lot! Every day looks a little different. But hours are long and this is a high stress job with tight deadlines. You will need to make personal sacrifices if you want to continue to advance, especially beyond manager. Also, it’s possible you can get on a long term project with very little flexibility you are not able to roll off of. Like most jobs, enjoyment is highly dependent on who your immediate supervisor is.
ProsLearn a lotConsLong hours
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
The work is different everyday.  And chances are you will work with a very high performing team.  Soak up as much information as you possibly can as its will spring your career in the right direction. 
Great company if you’re willing so sign the majority of your life over to work. Good benefits and mediocre pay, but looks great on a resume. No job flexibility for people below the manager level
fabulous organization you will work harder than you thought you could but it is a great place to learn and grow for some it’s a great place to be from than at
I started working for EY as a Junior Auditor 6 months ago. My experience is very mixed. If you are lucky enough to have a good helpfull manager, you will learn a lot and the tasks are fine. However due to most seniors and managers being very busy, they have not time to explain and let you figure things out for yourself. This makes it that your feedback loop comes very delayed and difficulties to improve and do your job adequately. 
Proscar, phoneConscompany culture, little guidance, long working hours
Great Opportunity to learn but no work life balance. You have the opportunities to work with big clients but the managing workload and team management are difficult. 
Great for remote workers. Adapt to global schedules--you will be working early mornings or later into the evening sometimes. Matrix management/review by committee is different.
Good young workers to hang out with, hard hours. My compensation was comparable to the market for what it's worth. Very dependent on good teams and will shape your experience.
Pros- culture, travel time, benefits (exercise and phone reimbursement was a plus), friendly, promoted every year, Cons- busy season, salary, salary increase 
"I interned with EY during the pandemic so it was completely virtual. That being said, my team was great with trying to give me a ""real"" internship experience! They were very helpful and even arranged events so we could meet in-person. I'm going back full time this Fall!"
Don't get caught up in the loyalty for this firm.  When times are rough for the firm YOU will be the first to go.  During a MASS layoff, EY purposely picked promoted employees to lay off, because of their establishment and pay grade within the firm.  This was a deviate practice that they pulled on me.  
ProsbenefitsConsSee review
Colleagues are smart and sociable.  Great educational resources.Very cliquish once you make partner or principal.No job security at any level.  Obsessed with rankings. New initiatives every few months.
ProsEducation, seminars, learning opportunities.ConsNo job security. 5 or 10 years with company means nothing.
EY has a strong culture and values their employees. Relationships are critical to being successful at the firm. The performance expectations are very high. 
I really enjoy working at EY, most people worry about the hours associated with working big 4 accounting but EY makes it really easy to work in a hybrid fashion so the hours don’t feel nearly as brutal. Working here I get valuable experience that I can bring with me throughout my career.
ProsFree lunches, great benefits, unlimited PTOConsLong Hours during busy season, challenging work.
You are expected to pick up and run w/ very little training. The jobs are very difficult and require a high financial analytical knowledge. The positions descriptions and what is told in the interview do not fully explain what the position really is. You will sit and stare at spreadsheets all day long. If that is your thing - its a great place to work. 
ProsGreat benefits - top tierConsWorking with Partners, very demanding, very high unrealistic expectations
One Of of the best company i ever worked and Excellent work culture. EY invest on their employees to grow which help EY customers EY delivered excellent quality work .
ProsQuality of WorkConsHealthcare Insurance
I'm in a specialized group with EY, so this will not pertain to other work groups. 15 weeks of overtime which we are fully aware, but year over year filing the same taxes gets very boring. Seriously great people though. 
Pros: Compensation and benefitsCons: Half the people you meet will be gone in a few months. Always short-staffed, and with seniors wiped out, don't expect to be trained properly. 
For as many surveys that leadership sends out, they don’t seem to act on the results of employee satisfaction. Want better retention? Pay people more, it’s as simple as that. I don’t care about or want to be reimbursed for a video game system, I don’t want a raise or vague bonus amount two months sooner, I want a higher salary now (especially with other B4 doing it). Sure that is impatient, but there isn’t much that is keeping people through busy season without an immediate incentive to do so. Stop alienating people in the name of DEI, listen to your people, follow actual science and not politically expedient science, and reward current employees instead of hunting down new ones all the time. The time investment will be well worth it.  Overall it is very valuable experience and looks great on a resume, but in a generation there won’t be any partners left to make decisions at the rate staffing issues have been going. I hope I’m wrong.
Flexible work solutions. High emphasis on work-life balance. Training and onboarding is superb. There are huge opportunities to give back to the community.
I like working here, the work is challenging and I get to learn a lot. There is a focus on diversity and inclusion. The projects are very prestigious. 
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
I certainly had good times during the 7 years or so at EY but it largely depends on whom you work with and if they care. As you move up into managerial role, you’d soon realize you don’t get necessary supports but you are the one to blame when things go south. The partners are no different from politicians. You figure the rest. 
I’ve had a good time with EY so far. The only thing is I would want to be able to pivot to other departments, which I don’t know if i can do with my current role. 
Great pay and benefits. Peers are awesome to work with. You receive excellent training and support multiple partners based on your work background. The only negative is if you are wanting to climb the corporate ladder, there is not much opportunity. 
The salary is not competitive. Limitation on advance. If you want to do a remote work, you always need to be prepared to be asked for more information before you do that.
Everything is solid if you enjoy the work there except for hours and stress. Overall good company, you just gotta really enjoy what you’re doing and be ok with long hours
ProsCareer developmentConsLong hours
Great place to work at this is challenging and awesome people to work with.  There is always work to be done and lot of training opportunities to allow you to grow.
You are an easily replaceable cog in the machine. Never forget that. It is not a culture of inclusion or growth, but off bottom line for EY partners. 
ProsSome good smart peopleConsFocus on the petty, not the big picture. Lack of honesty from management.
The workplace culture is great. I received lots of support from management and my team. People are always willing to help. I also learnt a lot in each engagement. However, the pay is too low and WLB sometimes also is a problem. 
ProsWonderful culture. I really enjoy work with my coworkers.ConsPay is low, Wlb
I came into EY consulting expecting to learn a lot and develop my skills, by showing my abilities. Consulting in the Finance practice has been mainly project management work my entire time at the firm. Taking notes during meetings, tracking, status updates, etc. The amount of technical work has been limited and I feel that anyone that can stay organized can work in consulting at EY. No knowledge is really necessary at the staff and senior levels, besides staying organized. If you want to move up and be successful, you have to tag yourself to the prominent people at the firm/practice and stick with them, which sometimes is a matter of luck as well.

The best reasons to work here are the name recognition and wide area of experience. There is a lot of opportunity get as broad or specific an experience as you would like as long as you have proven results.It can be hard to balance work and life, especially during busy seasons.
"I chose to be in EY because of supposedly the many available choice of projects in data analytics and tech in the public sector. What they don't say is that EY is a sub contractor in almost all these projects. I've been in 3 different contracts here  EY is still in build mode, with the ""any contract is better than no contract"" mentality, meaning partners want to make sure they keep the contract even if it means having people work overtime but not billing those hours to the government. They staff projects with recent college hires, have only 1-2 hires with relevant experience and accept any work that requires a 5 FTE count with experience (this is in tech anyway) but staff them with 1 person with experience and 5 with no experience. Run away from here. There are better companies with better projects if you have technical skills. Unlimited PTO is a marketing ploy because you still have required billable hours (translates to about 15 days of leave which is standard in industry). "
ProsGood benefitsConsNo good projects
EY is an amazing place to work.  You will have access to the brightest people across all industries and unlimited resources to help you solve complex problems and learn at an accelerated pace.  I enjoyed my time with EY and parlayed my five-year career in public accounting to a corporate leadership role that has quickly bridged the gap in the work/life/compensation balance that I gave up during my time in audit.
My review may not align with other reviews, but I find myself in a role that has no advancement. There are positions at EY that have no path forward and management is aware. I would leave, but the benefits are very good. Unlimited PTO and remote work to name a few. 
ProsUnlimited PTOConscommute downtown, paying to park, roles without advancement
After the initial training period, your work schedule is more flexible, as long as deadlines are met each month. The first couple weeks of the month are the most hectic and can easily become 70 to 80+ hour weeks, since most deadlines are set to mid-month. The last couple of weeks of the month are more relaxed, as there are mainly only maintenance tasks left in preparation for the next month. You get all of the support that you need from your seniors, trainers, and other coworkers, as everyone works in conjunction as a team. After two years, you have the option of diagonal movement into other departments if you so wish. 
Overall, EY in general deserves five stars. That being said, as one steps down the ladder to the middle management area of EY, things can get a little dicey on a routine basis e.g. lack of adequate headcount, lack of meaningful upward communication, and overall, top leadership's understanding of the non-client facing operational side of the business.
Frequently working over 60+ hours. Some teams are better than others but difficult to get on the right team if not initially placed there. Good launch pad for career but be prepared to pay for it in blood, sweat, and tears.
ProsSwag and cool peopleConsNo work life balance, boring
Typical day is usually working on client related tasks. Very fast pace. Steep learning curves on new clients. Get to learn a lot but client relations can be hard to deal with.
ProsWork from homeConsNo work life balance
They offered a high salary. The working environment was good, however there was a culture of fear which everyone was talking about. Seeing my mates getting fired often, I found out I'm working in a place where my space was not secured.

I was disappointed with my assignment as a seasonal employee during tax season with Ernst Young. I expected them to treat seasonal employees better and appreciate the effort and they fell short.
A typical day at work includes working in teams in an office. There are lunch breaks and social events for the employees to socialize and have a break from work. 
Work life balance is terrible. Expect 60 hours a week starting in august and ending in march. If I could I would of started in a private role. Just my 2 cents. 
ProsManagement is good. Free dinners during busy seasonConsWork life balance. Pay
The people are nice, work is work. If you are interested in becoming a CPA, it's a good place to work. You'll get chance to work with many people and learn a lot.
Management is supportive of your career and provide plenty of resources to help interns. I had great time during my internship. Near the end of the internship, us interns got to fly out to Orlando, FL for an international intern conference at a Disney resort. We had a great time at the EY events and networking with others from around the world.
This employer provided excellent benefits.  Unfortunately, there was no growth potential.  You will feel underappreciated, and not at all valued.  You were considered a slacker if you only worked 40 hours/week. 
The engagements are challenging in a good way. Benefits are nice, but hours are very, very long and sometimes unpredictable. Team spirit is at all times high.
ProsTeam relations, good clients & engagementsConsWlb

EY is a great firm to work for but SDC (service delivery center) was not. Pay for entry level is just horrible. No work life balance. The people you work with are great and even the manager were good. But upper management says one thing and does something completely different.

People aren’t lying about crazy busy season hours. Sometimes the workload is crazy, but you learn A TON. The people at EY are very smart, high caliber people. Great place to start your career.
EY is invested in the wellbeing of its staff and strives to create new and enriching incentives to better the employee experience. I would like to see more of a targeted goal/vision for the organization as most SLs are operating in silos.
ProsGreat benefits Inclusive environmentConsRed tape with approvals
Many opportunities to advance your career forward. Good coworkers, depending on which department you work for. Management helps you with your professional goals.

When a company has a culture, it permeates the organization. This can be both good and bad. EY is a solid organization with a great reputation. The company makes no issues that any employee who is not an accountant or in some client support capacity, is not important.  There are people in management who care and treat employees with dignity and respect. Upper management is mostly indifferent at best. 
ProsGreat benefits, plenty of time offConsLittle to no advancement, below market pay, indifferent upper management.
No objective, no project, bad management.Management by stress Is the only objective, and it makes people aggressive, unhappy, and poorly productive.No support from the management.
Applying skills in the day to day work environment enables me to identify situations of potential inequity and find ways to mitigate them. Learning how culture impacts your preferences in how you work and communicate and the implications for teaming and collaboration. Adapting my own style and techniques to work effectively with others. The most enjoyable part of the job is a Team that shows passion and dedication to find daily satisfaction in delivering value to others.Before leading others you must lead yourself and become aware of how you learn, what you learn and who you learn from. Teaching and inspiring as many people as possible through the lessons I've learnt in life so that they can go on to become and fulfill their desires to the fullest.

Hired in the technology practice for a growing government sector practice. I am very technical and was told my skills will be valuable because they have too many functional or business oriented folks. Well projects here are mostly strategy focused with limited opportunities to work in new tech. Perhaps if it was I the commercial practice. Would not recommend if you prefer hands on work. Good health care though and unlimited PTO (but everyone has a minimum number of bailable hours required). More upper management that have the authoritarian style of leadership.

Pros: An inclusive environment with young colleagues. Co-workers are easy to make friends with and most people i have worked with are enjoyable to be around. You learn a lot really quick and learn valuable skills that can translate to other jobs. Promotions are guaranteed if you are average or above. Cons: A typical day involves getting done with as much stuff you can. It's a constant deadline you & the team are chasing. I have found that most all teams are understaffed. This past busy season lasted from Jan thru May for me. I had co-workers my level (staff & senior) in busy season until July. Managers work busy season hours almost year round. Your hard work is rewarded with more work and you feel under-appreciated and are rarely thanked.

This Job is highly dependent and the engagements you are place on.

ProsVariety of projectsConsUnable to receive pay for un-used vacation upon resignation
The admin side of EY (personal experience) is a really great place to work. There is a strong emphasis on teamwork, both within your team and between your team and others. Teams are around 20 people so with a bit of work, it's not too difficult to know everyone you work with and know them well. Communication is a big plus. Managers will conference with you about your goals and plans, personal and professional alike, and take steps to help you accomplish them.Definitely would recommend this as a great starting position for those interested in admin work for a large, well-known firm. The only potential drawbacks are the length of time it takes to progress professionally--it does require a lot of patience to get where you want to be.
ProsGreat cross-training opportunities, excellent teamwork, good benefitsConsTakes some time to advance in the company

The team culture is amazing but the hours are long and stressful. I and my colleagues had our fair share of 2am nights. You will learn a lot but your experience will depend on the team and industry you are serving. I really enjoyed working with my team and there are ample amount of mentorship and opportunities offered. You are surrounded by highly motivated individuals who are willing to work hard and do long hours for 6+ months out of the year. Working together with seniors and managers who are in their 20s definitely make the EY experience rewarding. The only concern is the lack of work life balance and the constant pressure to meet deadlines. All the teams I have been on ran extremely lean despite management constantly assuring the staffs and seniors that we will receive enough staff support. 
ProsGreat opportunities and straightforward career trajectoryConshigh staff turnover, lack of work life balance
I have been working in the SDC for over a year and it is a joke. The initial job posting is nothing like you do. They hire Bio, Gender Studies, PoliSci, ex. students for this job. 0 training, awful pay. I am basically living paycheck to paycheck.
Prosbenefits from EYConsEverything else
"Your experience depends significantly on where you work, what you do, and who you work with. My experience was largely negative. Pigeon-holed into a team that developed my skills in only a narrow niche, leaving me with little ""portable skills"" to take elsewhere. Required to work insane hours to the point that I would often get only 3-4 hours of sleep per night. Unfortunately my EY experience was a good example of how an employer can abuse its employees without any negative repercussion on the employer, because it simply weeds out the employees who can't take the abuse and is left with those who are able to tolerate it and focus 100% of their time on work, leaving no time for personal/family life. As I said, your mileage may vary. I am sure some EY employees have very different and much more positive experiences, but be forewarned that in general this is a company that is concerned only with making money and not with the welfare of their employees. EY is hardly unique in that regard, but that doesn't mean it should be excused for treating employees in this manner."
Great people to work with, and many opportunities to learn at the beginning of your career. The company has a great culture that's open minded and accepting, but suffers from the long work hours as all other Big 4 firms. As great as the people at the firm are, the lack of work-life balance overshadows this completely. Great place to start, but should leave as soon as other opportunities open up.
ProsHappy hours, nice people, diverse learning experience, structured career path, open to moving your career in the direction you want, expense reimbursement for phone and fitness activitiesConslong busy seasons with very long hours, people don't respect off hours, salary is substantially below industry, 401k matching doesn't begin until 2nd year, only 2% match

I’ve been working at Proud Moments for a few years. The company has grown and improved in so many ways since I started. The office is great at responding and assisting with any issues I come across. They’re able to lay out a plan as to how to resolve the problem. The pay is probably better than any other company. I do feel that the company could have better policies to help with the work-life balance. Although the company has improved, the motto seems to be work, work and work! I also feel the company could do a better job at communication inregards to new positions opening up, raises and expectations.
ProsNoneConsNone
EY will provide a lot of learning opportunities if you stick around for couple of years. Great people, great culture. The main disadvantage is understaffed team which result in more hours for everyone. Every year it gets worse. Still happy that worked there but not a forever job.
ProsFlexibile schedule, work from homeConsLong hours
I was a part of business consulting. Work life balance wasn't great. Pay is also not that great. However learning was good and exit opportunities are also good if one can pick up the right skill set
It all depends on the team you're on. I've had good managers and bad ones. Most people are interested in seeing you develop, but you have to put in a lot of hours no matter what. Not a job for the fainthearted but worth it if you stay in the long-term. A lot of learning opportunities and exposure to big name clients. Long and stressful busy season but it makes you appreciate the slower times of year.
Be prepared to work long hours on a variety of clients. Managers often don't have the time and/or willingness to help you and are always acting with a secret agenda.
ProsPay, Experience, LearningConsLong Hours, No Work/Life Balance, Poor Managers
Salary is okay but below industry average. Otherwise great working environment. Attrative benefits. Work from home since march 2020. People come and go. 
But it really depends on your team whether this experience will make or break you. I didn't feel supported by my team and I didn't see myself advancing beyond a first year. Seniors have to take disrespect from everyone. I don't think it's possible to have a life outside of work in this field. The only mistake I made when leaving was not expressing how absolutely draining this job is mostly because of understaffing.

Most of us get in to get out. That’s the case here. The big four will test your ability to manage high levels of stress and there is always more work to go around.
I have worked with many different teams at EY, and the experience varies greatly from client to client, team to team. With a competent manager and decent client, the experience would be very positive. However, with an incompetent manager or terrible client, it can be miserable. Do your research on the team before joining.Also, unlimited vacation sucks.

EY is a great place to start your career as it will open up many opportunities to you in the private sector. However, I just couldn't see myself doing the job longterm. The hours are just too high for the pay and the work is extremely monotonous and boring. They give a lot of paid days off, but you earn them when you spend 10 days straight working until 4am during busy season.
ProsLots of paid holidays, Flexible scheduleConsHours, Pay, Bad 401k match
I worked at EY for over 2 years. There is someone called experience manager who will make sure your schedule is not crazy overloaded. Which gives a great work life balance. Busy season can get tough and overwhelming but it does come to an end after 2 or 3 months. The non busy time work is super flexible. You can pretty much work anytime you want. And unlimited PTO is real. There isnt even a lot you need to do to to get it. Just shoot an email to all your teams reasonably in advanced and you are good to go. Probably cant do a whole week during busy season. As long as you are reasonable..
ProsLaid back and flexibleConsLow pay
Infrastructure is nice; its a pool-workplace. No fun and games, but it has its perks. Good management, still has that mentality about people having to be productive and having the numbers in order to get a promotion. It has nice benefits: medical insurance for you and your spouse as well as your children if you have any. Hard part: working with clients that makes it difficult to meet your KPIs.
ProsHealthcare; Christmas Bonus by Law
Got to work with a lot of interesting people and teams, but the hours were long, particularly during busy season. As an intern, it isn't bad because you are paid hourly, but the idea of working 60 hours a week on salary isn't appealing.
Like all public accounting jobs you work long hours. Pay is decent and you learn a lot. You deal with audit clients and tend to management's needs. You get to see quite a bit and just need to stay organized
Prosbenefits, flexibilityConslong hours, weekends
Great place to work for career advancement. Variety of experiences in terms of clients and teams. Supportive and intelligent team members who push you to learn and gain skills.
I have had amazing experiences at EY, but it just takes one bad manager to ruin things.  If you are lucky enough to get staffed on a good team, things can be great.  If not, you will hate your job and be miserable every day.
ProsPrestige of working for a big 4 firmConsA few bad apples

ProsNaConsNa
EY is definitely a great place to start your career. There is lots of room for growth, and you learn a ton. However, the hours are taxing over time and management often plays favorites. There are lots of politics at EY. 
ProsGreat benefits, company perks, growth/advancement, flexibilityConsLittle to no work/life balance, cliquey management
Big 4 tax. Long hours during busier times of the year that see you in the office before sunup and home after sundown. Generally, managers and higher are extremely willing to teach and help staff/seniors grow. EY invests in its employees in training but they expect you to work a lot of hours. You'll learn a ton and get great experience. Benefits are mid-tier compared to industry. Nothing to write home about but also do not stand out as worse than the norm.
good overall, great environment, competitive environment, training for all employees. Can't choose much on clients. Partners help a lot on job. Friednly colleagues.
Great culture! Good teaming and leadership support.   Would highly recommend to anyone seeking a new role.  Learning and training is also very good and on demand.
I feel very comfortable working here and I am very comfortable with the environment here. The leadership and team are very professional and have provided me with great help. This is a good starting point to start your career.
Great place to learn for interns, recent graduates and anyone who's willing and able to work 60 plus hours per week under a lot of stress.  Not a place for an experienced professional with children and looking for career advancement.  
ProsBig Four reputation on your resumeConsSame than any other large CPA firm: Long hours, no work/life balance and demanding engagements
Typical big 4 accounting - long hours for portions of the year and high stress. Especially in a smaller market, it can drag on a lot as smaller private jobs never bit their deadlines. I’ve learned a lot and worked with great people but easy to burn out 
ProsFlexibilityConsHours, staffing
The interview process was incredibly easy and getting started didn’t take long. I worked here for about 2 years and went in with no experience so they provide training. Training is essentially throwing you into a situation and seeing if you sink or swim. Employees are always on call and expected to be available. I was full time but when covid hit, my hours were cut in half which meant paychecks were tiny. I made too much to receive unemployment, but too little to actually pay my bills. Pre-Covid employees were burnt out.
ProsFree lunchConsNo breaks
managers care about you and your growth. People are generally nice. You get to work on a variety of projects within different industries. It feels like changing jobs every few months. 
Prospeople are niceConspay isn't as good
Si bien se aprende mucho en la firma, es demasiada carga laboral para tan bajos salarios
While I love the culture and work and the exposure to smart people, the life as an auditor has gone downhill. Booming job market means high turnover and much more work. Good people are getting burned out and quitting and partners do not seem to care much since their margins are just going up. Rotten compensation system where you get to do the work of 2 people when someone quits but do not get compensated for it all as the comp is so structured. So regardless if you are a superstar or suck - you are pretty much paid the same.
Prosgreat culture, smart peopleConslong hours, bad pay
"Working at E&Y was one of the best career choices I made. You work with the best of the best, the smartest folks in industry. Everyone was an ""A"" student otherwise you would not be there. Variety of clients and specialization. Connections for life. Very much a team atmosphere. Work hard. Play hard."
ProsGreat learning experience. Great clientsConsNone
Work life balance will be destroyed but anything else is good, good pay, co workers is fine, your counselor and manager will be great. You will love your teammates.
EY is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. While it is very corporate, it is great experience for those looking to get into corporate finance and accounting. 
ProsGreat environment, a lot of room for advancement, great pay and benefitsConsVery hectic during tax season. Sometimes it feels like you live in the office during it.
Fast pace, very smart people, depending your team work life balance may not be there.Benefit are comparable to the other big four Very flexible you can learn a lot 
Work hard and you'll be rewarded.  This place is amazing and it take a lot to get in because they are so picky when it comes to finding the right fit.  Also, EY is really focused on building a great culture....from my perspective they're doing a great job
ProsUnlimited vacation, 4 months of maternity or paternity leaveConslong hours but worth it
the company is so good for starters. you will all support needed succeed in the organization. if you can work hard it can give you opportunities to grow. pay is little less comparatively
Prosgood working cultureConscompensation is not so good
I was on the consulting side. EY or any big 4 has great benefits and compensation but you will work for it. There is little work life balance. Many time they expect you to work 16 hour days. Sometimes I felt like majority of my job was creating PowerPoints. They give you unlimited PTO but don't worry you will never have time to take it. May care about D&I internally but many times they accept clients that do not. Its hard because you work for EY but really you work for the Client. Sometimes you wonder why different clients are accepted. For example although EY is inclusive you may work for a client who publicly does not support a certain group of people and you wonder...

Like the other Big 4 public accounting firms, EY is a great place for a budding accountant fresh out of college to start their careers. You can gain exposure to a large number of industries and clients, each facing their own unique issues that EY has to help resolve. There are a ton of great resources to learn from; there literally seems to be an expert in every possible aspect of accounting working at the firm. The company's management is also very supportive of workplace flexibility, although this mindset varies from team to team. However, working here is definitely not without its faults. As a client serving organization, expectations are set extremely high for employees and there is always a deadline to meet, often times conflicting. Busy seasons are brutal and just when you think it's all over, another client might be facing a new issue and you're working on a new deadline again. Things come up all the time and you always feel on call 24/7. There is a definite feeling of a lack of work-life separation and that can really wear on you over time. While most people are very supportive here and want to help you succeed in your careers as it makes their lives easier the better you are at your job as well, there will also be times when you don't see eye to eye with a fellow colleague and still be forced to work together on a project. You won't always get along with everyone you work with and you can't choose who you get to work with either. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect, you can't even pick your projects most of the time. Project assignments are distributed based on - more...
ProsLots of Knowledge about the Industry, Great Resources, Resume Builder, Flexibility PromotedConsLong Hours, Very Demanding Profession, High Stress Work Environment
It’s public accounting so long work hours, but I learned an incredible amount. Every audit was different so I learned about different industries. Great management 
ProsLearningConsLong hours, low pay
Worked here for over a year. Very relaxed, and you learn a lot. They don't pay much and don't want to convert contractors. Deloitte offered more money for the same job title, and remote for less experience. They don't have to pay market value because they have thousands of people trying to join.
Prosfree coffee, nice people, some jobs are remoteConslow pay, extended contracting periods (1yr +)
EY is trying their best to encourage work life balance. Being that it is a global/national firm, there are many opportunities/projects that pop up that make your experience engaging and interesting. The firm's focus on Purpose is a step in the right direction.
Prosunlimited PTO, $1000 wellness benefit, summer & winter breakConsinternal promotions don't come with a big of a raise as external hires, which is the norm for a lot of places though.
Great learning opportunities, great benefits. Unlimited vacation. The hours of the job can be tough, especially during busy season. In general, the people you work with are great. Good experience if you are down to work hard. 
Work life balance was not great and all depends on luck with regards to managers you get to work with, some of whom are terrible.You feel very much like a cog in a wheel 
Good place to start working . Long hours as to be expected in all of public accounting . Get winter and summer breaks . Experience is entirely team dependent , could have great team and it will be good and a good client or bad team and your life is miserable 
You come for the opportunity. You stay for the people but in public accounting there is not much work life balance. Deadlines are real and constant. However the people are great and will make you want to stay.
ProsThis is a great place to start your career, You are able to consistently more up and learn new things, great culture, great peopleConsWork life balance is non-existent, I will never understand the expectation that you are required to work overtime but not paid for it, You basically have to do whatever it takes to get the work done, no matter what.
Pros - Great people at a junior level- management push you to develop - good learning opportunities Cons- work life balance can be an issue- toxic culture they're trying to tackle- can't always trust people - sales culture
Upon joining EY, I was hired for a different role than the one I am in currently. While I found my initial role fulfilling in the beginning, I was looking for more challenges and realized that in-order for my career to advance the way I wanted to was if I moved over to a client facing position within the firm. Through extensive internal networking and internal support, EY leadership was gracious enough to not only allow me the opportunity to interview for the group I was interested in but also made a huge exception for me to join after interviewing. It is a true testament to their commitment for their employees professional and personal growth. I could not be more thankful to work at such a great firm. I am currently very happy with my role and am excited for the continued challenges and opportunities that await.
ProsCareer advancement, Management, Culture
it is the people that make EY such a great place to work.  Inclusiveness and Diversity is a priority.  They are very good at helping you balance work/personal life.
ProsThe benefits and pay are above averageConsthey are outsourcing positions
pros: lots of perks : OT meals, fitness fund, internet & cellphone reimbursementsCons: work life balance is challengingreally high turnover unlimited PTO seems like a scam
Overall EY benefitted my career from a growth and experience perspective. However, the time put in does not result in career success and proper compensation.
Working at EY is a good learning experience and definitely increases your value as a professional once you decide to get out of the firm. Really glad to have very nice co-workers turned friends. Benefits are really good too. However, expect to work really really long hours due to strict client deadlines. There’s no such thing as work life balance for auditors and the stress and pressure just continuously increases every busy season.
ProsFlexible hours, variety of clients, continuous learning and progress, very nice peopleConsVery long hours, strict deadlines, overlapping engagements
your job satisfaction and work/life balance will be entirely dependent on the team you are put on. Currently they are going through critical staffing issues likely due to the lack of pay raises during the year and the hot job market in the DMV area. the remote environment has been detrimental to the leverage model as it inhibits the ability to coach and receive coaching.
Prostons of resources and learning opportunities.Conspay before manager level; work/life balance is not realistic
Management is caring. The people are great. There is great room for growth and advancement. Volunteering and giving back to the community is one of EY's mission.
ProsGreat perksConsNone
The lack of work life balance and constant need is really draining. Staffing isn’t good. While I love the people on my team, the job is too much. I think some people can really succeed, just not for everyone.
Great place to work. Work is normally appreciated. Sometime very busy / stressful. Great amount of flexibility. Fair payment I would say. Overall, happy to work here.
Good place to work overall, especially at the beginning of your career or if you land in mature practice later in your career.  Your individual experience is somewhat dependent on the practice you are in.  If you are savvy and can navigate the organization, you will find your niche. Change is the only constant! 
ProsGood culture. Take care of their people.ConsSome uninspired leaders. Slow to implement change and make bold decisions.
EY was a great company to work for. Good  benefits and compensations. Provided a great working environment and heavily focused on team work. Ample training was provided to excel in tasks.
ProsWorking atmosphere. Values teamworkConsLogging and keeping track of time for tasks
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
Stable, boring work, with no real growth opportunities. Some of the older guys were good people, stuck in a mediocre job that paid just enough to keep them but not enough to make their lives good. Compared to other hourly gigs the rates weren’t bad but they were treating employees like contractors and constantly changing the terms of employment by using 3rd party hr companies as fronts and cancelling and forcing the redefining of work contracts to remove benefits. Super sketchy director, reminded me a lot of the boss from that animatronic TV show, the dinosaurs. Free food on the reg was the best benefit they had going for them. 
ProsFree lunchesConsAlmost everything else
Great plan to start your career, very good training/education while working, EY experience is unusually appreciated and well-respected by industry. Incredibly talented and hard working people with the exception of some who have questionable lack of competency/desire to work at EY. During busy season depending on your sub-service lines, no work life balance. 
ProsFlexibility, talented peopleConslong hours, pressure/fast pace
EY Is a good place to start your career, learn from the best, and work on interesting projects. The work can be hard but that's expected taking into consideration the clients.
If I was asked to work here again, I would definitely say no!!! I have never felt welcome here, I will never go back again. Management plays favorite and most of them do not care about employees' development. 
ProsFood in the kitchen areaConsNever felt welcome
EY is a great place to develop your skill set and meet people. You will learn more here in a shorter period of time than you would in industry. However, this comes at a cost. Yes, there is flexibility in terms of when you start and end your day and as you move higher up the ranks, no one will question where you are and what you are doing, but there is an expectation that you will get your work done. And it will be more work than you ever thought possible.The firm's management seems to have taken a dive. There was a time when I trusted that management was making the right decisions, but in the past several years, I felt less and less like they had a strategic path that made sense.
ProsGreat experience makes you marketableConsSo. Much. Work.
"Very much what you can expect from Big 4 consulting. You will work very hard, long hours, under very high expectations, for a wide variety of leaders that can be both good and bad, in the hopes of being promoted. And, in the end, your performance reviews and career progression/success opportunities will come down to only 2 basic ""metrics"". So focus intently on those 2. Partner/Principle is the pinnacle goal; you will need to be progressing to that level or you will be worked out of the organization over time. Keep in mind that in reality very very few ever make it to Partner/Principle. Most attain this through a ladder of movements between firms. Everyone else is busting it and selling, selling, selling. If you are willing to put in a ton of hours, work on a variety of projects, do whatever it takes to create and maintain positive impressions from at least 5-10 Partners who will go to bat for you, then you can make it."
ProsGood comp; Variety of work; Some of your co-workersConsSurvivor Island type culture; Its all about selling
Great opportunities to travel and learn on some of the biggest multinational clients.  Culture and employee development is very poor. Worklife balance does not exist and management can be very demanding of employees time. 
EY was good for an entry level audit role but after that the time commitment increases at every level. Hard to transfer out of small offices, service lines, if your current executives need you. 
ProsFlexible hours, working area, 4 months of paternity leave!ConsLong hours, extended busy seasons, low mobility
Great place to learn and grow, job security and pay is fair. They have tried to support during Covid but the work life balance is barely existent. They ensured we had the tools, internet coverage etc but their are no boundaries now.
ProsTotal compensation packageConsWork life
Each day presents a new challenge but you are working with a lot of smart people so you learn a lot and get to experience new things that add to overall career growth.
As a contractor, the job is great for flexibility and remote work.  I am not sure about any upward mobility or opportunities to get hired on full time; since I am in the middle of a contract.  The people are nice and it suits my lifestyle at this time.
ProsFlexibility, remote workConsuncertainty with contracts, uncertainty about full time employment
After 15 + years with the firm, the culture has taken a shift for the worse.  Poor work-life balance.  Unlimited vacation = no vacation.  Progression is slow from Staff to Senior Manager.  Few mentoring and development opportunities. 
Defintely no micro management. You come in or at the moment wfm and you pretty much do tasks as requested from your PPMDs and executives and in downtime do training independently. As long as they don't complain you will do great. Hardest part is making sure you learn and gain more skills to provide better service. Work life balance is amazing they are very flexible. Benefits are out of this world as of this year we have unlimited vacation and so much more. EY is truly an amazing place to be an EA.
Prosfree lunches all the time, tons of time off and offices close for 1 week twice a year, great pension and 401kConshonestly none
The pay does not equal the amount of work one does, and there are a LOT of administravive procedures that make the day to day experience very uncomfortable and that takes focus away from you.
ProsLots of technologyConsPay
"EY has a nice con going.  They get flooded with smart applicants just out of college with 4.0 GPAs.  They somehow convinced the world that it was ""great to have EY on the resume"".  They pay you an absolutely dismal wage then give you a massive undertaking.  I really liked the challenge and the responsibility.  But after raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars for EY then looking at my paychecks, it got really old, really fast.  EVERYONE leaves EY within 3 years.  They ONLY hire management from OUTSIDE the company.  This company is an absolute clown show.  If you read this and still decide to work there, you cant say someone dudnt try to warn you."
ProsNoneConsEverything
Great benefits, unlimited PTO, flexible work schedule, holidays, good health benefits, 401k match. Management do their best to keep employees safe during this unprecedented times. 
Managers guided intern associate for the respectful programs. Tax was not that of a head ache since it was not in a busy season. Work life can be heavy cause at the end of the day it's Big4
I should start off by saying that I got this job fresh out of college and to be able to work for a Fortune 500 company is a HUGE honor that I'm still so grateful for. However, this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. Being an EA has it's perks but overall you're just a glorified secretary for 5-8 people across multiple different time zones in a virtual setting. I've enjoyed working at EY; just not in the Louisville office. 
ProsAMAZING benefits, super relaxed office environment (can only speak to the Louisville office), different training opportunitiesConsPoor management, no room for advancement unless you want to switch jobs completely
Comfortable place to work. Good team and people. Compensation is lower than common company but in line with consulting companies. Good working balance with private life

"My team was outsourced to EY from our original company and told that it would be a huge opportunity for our careers, but then a few months later, our team was laid off suddenly. They decided to outsource our jobs again, but this time to teams overseas which resulted in us being laid off. They did give us 2 months' notice which was somewhat helpful, but many of us felt misled because they kept telling us to ""hang in there"" through the growing pains that took place after the original outsourcing ""business transformation"" event. If I had known then what I know now, I would've started looking elsewhere immediately and been long gone before the layoff ever took place. Not to mention, the whole business transformation process was a waking nightmare. They put someone who was lazy and completely incompetent in charge of our team, and that led to a lot of dissatisfaction and confusion, not to mention lots of blaming/finger-pointing and toxicity; honestly, it was chaotic and made me dread what the next day would bring as it felt like we were constantly putting out fires before new ones started, and had very little support and guidance to address them. I don't know how EY runs the rest of the business so this is just my isolated perspective, but based on this experience I wouldn't recommend it. Also - last I heard, their decision to outsource abroad actually made things worse so the decision was clearly made for short-sighted, cost-saving reasons, and not really strategically aimed at supporting their client's needs long term."
Been here 5 years plus. Benefits package, growth, stable industry, virtual environment, opportunities for learning, collaboration, transparent leadership. 
ProsCompetitive salary, growth, benefitsConsLack of clear career path in CBS
Very good people and culture but the work can be a hit or miss. Sometimes you’ll be expected to work many extra hours even during weekends depending on management 
The hours were pretty bad year round, but you do learn a lot, which sets you up to be successful once you leave the firm. Good benefits, culture is hit or miss depending on your engagements. A good place to spend a couple of years, learn and leave. 
A great place to start your accounting career. Expect to work hard however. Quite a bit of politics, but if you are able to navigate and except that, you'll fit right in. 
EY supports you and gives you all of the expectations of you in writing. Even when that’s not enough, they still support you. Great company to work for and the benefits are unheard of with the majority of companies out there. 
ProsBenefits, community supportConsNothing at this time
It is Big 4 - long hours, high expectations. Opportunities to learn, but you are just a number. I don’t regret the experience - lots of exposure to different things. 
Good place to start out a career in - you need to be proactive though if you want to get promoted within CBS, as there are employees that have been working in the same position for over 20 years.
With the right management team, you will succeed.Team has different meanings in different places.  There are opportunities for growth if you can pave your own way.
ProsflexibilityConsFavorites are played among employees
I have been with EY for 20 yrs and I can tell you I enjoyed working there everyday. People are very smart and hard working. The benefits are great and due to Pandemic, we are able to work from home since March 2020.
ProsPeople, benefits, locationsConswork/life balance
EY is an amazing company, and it is very difficult not to be in love with it. They truly go by what they say, whenever you join and however long you stay, EY gives you an experience which lasts a lifetime.
EY is a great firm that cares about their employees.  I have been with the firm 24 years and they have always made me feel as if I matter.  EY has made Forbes top 100 list for over 25 years and it is well deserved.

Loved the people-oriented nurturing culture and the opportunities to work on exciting projects alongside with some of the most talented minds. An Ideal place for new graduates.
Working at EY was generally a good experience. The benefits and pay were fair-good, and most people who one worked with on daily basis were also good. The most difficult aspect of the job revolved around meeting your billable hour quota (which unless you’re a senior manager or above is out of your control, mainly - no matter what they tell you), and budget restraints. Working at EY truly does depend on your team. I worked with a fairly laid back, yet professional group and never worked too, too late, but, again this varies widely from group to group. Overall it was a good experience not a great one. I would recommend to people who are recent college grads - as the pay is fair and the work as a staff is also fair. As you move up the expectations are heavily amplified and somewhat unrealistic. 
ProsBenefits, people (most), payConsBillable hour, up or out policy
 My duties allowed me to be the first point of contact, with this encounter  generates what will be my next task.  I handle all incoming calls, hoteling reservations, schedule meetings and arrange lunch and dinners for meetings for that day.  I handle visitor badges and I take pictures for the ID badges.  I am a liaison  for the building engineer.  I maintain the companies phone directory for our region and  many other clerical task. The company provides training. Employees are recognized both privately and publicly throughout the cooperation. The hardest part of my job is clearing out my emails each day.  The most enjoyable part of my job are the pleasant employees.
ProsToo many to listConsHaving your department outsourced.
A good place to start your corporate career, wherever I go I get recognized by the EY brand, I'm EY-Alumni forever. I learned about the culture and I'm proud I chose EY.
Great for jumpstarting your career. Great to stay until manager or senior manager to get experience and leadership, however once you leave you realize partners are more concerned with filling jobs and clients vs you staying with the company
ProsExperience and exposure. Always learningConsBenefits arent great, long hours
"It's a great way to jumpstart your career but there's virtually no work/life balance. Compensation is above average for a recent college grad, but probably not for the amount of hours you're required to work. Workplace culture varies significantly across cities, service lines, and even individual teams. You're surrounded by (mostly) competent and ambitious people, most of whom are young and also recent college grads.However, I'm becoming more and more disappointed with how leadership is treating its employees. In response to the pandemic, the firm froze raises for all employees not in a promotion year. However, when it was announced the firm had record numbers despite the pandemic, a meager raise was given out right before busy season. Additionally, the firm unilaterally decided to implement an ""unlimited vacation"" policy starting in 2021. They claimed it was to improve work/life balance, but they failed to mention the millions they would be saving by not having to pay out accrued vacation. This feels like a slap in the face for a company who touts themselves as a caring, diverse company.To summarize, this is one of the best methods to jumpstart your career, but expect to work long hours in exchange, and definitely don't expect the leadership to care."
ProsGreat learning experiences, Surrounded by young peers, Great way to get exposed to many different companies/industriesConsWork/life balance, Excessive hours, Poor leadership
Not the worst. Far from the best.  The organization would do well to consider fostering a more inclusive culture and provide clearer pathways for people who want to develop area expertise.

EY ensures you have what you need to succeed and thrive in their environment. Your career is in your hands and there’s plenty of assistance available.
ProsBenefits, flexibility, tons of perks for mental and physical health, great work cultureConsVision plan isn’t that great
Worked here 15 plus years. Retiring in April. Amazing place to work! I would recommend EY to anyone. In a world of so much uncertainty, this firm provided me with the comfort and growth I look for in a corporate business. 
ProsPay, benefits, company perksConsI didnt take advantage of all the amazing opportunities.
I had a number of good and challenging engagements that I performed well at. and received good feedback for. However, my practice lead and performance manager took a disliking to me and continually belittled and marked down key work, was completely lacking in encouragement or support, yet who sought all decisions to be centralized through them.Exceptionally toxic work environment.
ProsCompensation; global opportunitiesConsSee above critique.
"Public Accounting (in particular a ""Big Four"" firm) is the best place to start your Accounting career. There are long hours, but it's the best place to learn. "
No longer what it used to be. A lot of politics and stress from upper level management. Often times require OT and work that is unbillable to satisfy clients.
Lot's of variety in clienbases will get you exposire to many different areas, however the hours are long, and you will be expected to work overtime. The best part of the job is the comraderie.
"A very down to earth approach, versus other Prof Service Companies. Enjoyed the directness of the Partners and their willingness to help. Love the results oriented approach work environment. It was all about , ""what you did versus what you say culture"".Would have never left, but they went through a Cap Gemini take over and all of the senior managers left the company.I feel the consulting group can be a major competitor to the Advertising industry. However, they need to figure out the creative capability and how they build that into their offering. It can not be a plug and play approach. As data, insight, strategy, creative and media channel are a continuum that drives an over Strategic Communications approach."
Proswork environmentConspartner track
Great place to start a career, learn teamwork and understand what it is to work hard, efficiently and engage with wide range of people. Work life balance can be difficult and you can likely find greater compensation in other careers. In the end, you need to really enjoy the work, the people and have a sense of purpose to stick around for the long haul.

ProsNo ProsConsStay away from GPS
Virtual model, 90+ EA's on a floor and 200+ in the US supporting various executives across the firm sectors. It was a learning experience and I gained skills and a strong work ethic. I left due to the lack of transparency from managers and leadership; low moral on the team; promotions and advancement is based on who you know and how competitive you are and what manager you have; not based on your work ethic, attendance, teaming attitude and the various hats you wear to support departments when short handed. Good for entry level assistants, I wouldn't suggest experienced assistants to apply if you are looking to advance your career.
ProsPay and PTO is descent.ConsSmokey mirrors and lack of transparency from leaderships and managers
I love working at EY. I am in an admin position. There is great flexibility, the work environment is positive, and the benefits offered are impressive. They really take care of and care about their employees at a local as well as national level. 
ProsBenefits, Pto, Flexibility
Great place to work. Really enjoyed my time. Management was extremely supportive of my desires and needs. Compensation package was great. Thoroughly enjoyed my time.
Recently, it seems like there's been a lot more turnover than in the past even during a COVID pandemic. That's left those who stay behind with more work to do at a place where you are already juggling multiple things. We're having to do a lot more while the industry still operates under the model that pay is going to be below market for what you can get in industry. It'd be interesting to see what happens in October when senior 3's who banked their bonus promote to manager and get their $25K bonus and whether there is going to be a big exodus.
ProsTraining, exposure to multiple clients and industry, job security, unlimited PTO, flexibility during non-busy season, $1K health allowanceConsunpredictable schedule, long hours, okay compensation
Over I loved working at EY. If you work in the core business services the benefits and pay are amazing. The culture is very positive and respectful. I would say that my position was pretty locked as far as growth and I knew that on the corporate level they would eventually eliminate my position. 
This review is specifically for the Consulting role.For most people, the main pull of this job is going to be job advancement. While the firm pays a lot of lip service to promoting based on performance over tenure, this isn't entirely true. In practice, there are still a minimum amount of time they want you to spend in each role. Only the absolute top performers (think culture coin) are able to get around this. Additionally, this timeline is changing and can be longer depending on who you roll up to. So, while your area might think it should take 3 years minimum to the next level, other areas will promote at 2 years. The travel aspect of the role is worse in practice than it is on paper. You may think at the travel percentage and think that it is manageable. Make sure to take into consideration that 4 days before your flight, you might not know when or where you traveling to. You truly must like travelling for work. This is different than normal travel. You will be in a crowded room with your team until most of the employees at the client have left. You are then typically encouraged to go to a team dinner. This can frequently result in you leaving your hotel at 8AM and not getting back until 9PM. This must be something you WANT to do. I was initially neutral on travelling for work, but I gradually began to hate it as time went on. Other notes: The type of projects you will be on a largely out of your control. Where you are travelling for you projects are largely out of your control. The compensation is competitive with other Big 4, but don't ever calculate your hourly - more...
ProsExpensing meals while traveling, job advancement (typically)ConsTravel, uncertainty, work life balance
"EY will allow you to grow quickly in your career but will ask for a significant sacrifice in return through lack of any work life balance. Extended hours were not strictly during busy season and ""slow"" times typically resulted with resource management finding a one-off assignment that would require overtime to fill your schedule. "
EY is a good place to work, but it takes a certain type of person to work here long term. you have to be willing to put in long hours. Can be stressful a lot of the time.
ProsFlexibilityConsLong hours
Fun and Worthwhile Company to Intern with.Enjoyed spending my first real-world accounting experience with EY. I look forward to working with the company again.
Work life balance (as in most consultancy firms), lower salary in comparison with other Big4 firms (from Senior Consultant level onwards). Can be rewarding from Senior Manager position onwards. Most people level on Senior Consultant level.
Worked in the audit division within financial services. Great learning curve as I was thrown into a lot of discussions with senior management early. Audit gave me to get a deep understanding of various wealth managers, bank and insurer processes and controls. 
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
ok place to work for. get busier as you move up the ladder. however I believe it's worth the experience even when you decide to leave or stay with the company 
Numerous opportunitiesEncourages innovation and being a self starterChampions diversity and inclusive leadershipNice people who work hard and love what they do
ProsCulture, caliber of people, compensationConsA matrix organization requires broad consensus to get things done
Client facing roles in EY are great CV builders for new graduates however hours are long, work life balance is poor and the office environment past senior level is very political.
ProsRelevant experienceConsNo work life balance
Like working for a secret society - never know who your boss is.  Totally mixed bag - really smart people as well as vicious partners. Watch your back.
ProsEventsConsLack of leadership
"Great place to start off or land mid- career. Advancing to top PPMDD level is a bit vague and there are obviously no guarantees. If that's your goal, make absolutely certain you want the role - if so, expect to blink and be retirement age. The firm is a great place to learn, but people here are mostly ""takers."""
ProsGreat learning opportunity, broad exposure to different engagement typesConsFavoritism, people don't practice what they preach
Typical day at work includes responding to client needs, managing expectations and supporting the understanding of executives and coaching staff. Responsible for re-working documentation to comply with new audit quality standards with little to no coaching or guidance. Pressure to meet higher quality standards with the same or less staff/senior resources. Little to no meaningful engagement or recognition from executives as they do not have an appreciation for the details of procedures performed. 
ProsJob security, promotions, routine policies/procedures, access to resourcesConsPoor recognition, low salary, high stress
It’s a great company. Good benefits, work from home. Friendly staff. Easy promotion if you have a good project. Bad pay, unlimited vacation, good parental leave benefits 
Really good company. Was very good at career development. Management was very nice. This is a really great place to start your career. Everything is so up to date. 
Pros: great resume-builder working at a company respected and recognized pretty much anywhere in the word. good progression and career opportunities.Cons: long hours, churn and burn mentality
it was a good place to start out but not enough room to grow. It's a good work enviornment, relax, but feedback can be inconsistent which makes work confusing. 
Good place to learn and grow. It is high-paced, with high-expectations and tons of overtime, but there is a good team culture that makes it almost enjoyable. 
ProsGreat management, support and structureConsNo work life balance during busy season
By hiring new joiners in big batches, a classroom-like community is created which is really nice.                
I have enjoyed my last 2 years at the job. I would recommend it to anyone as a good starting place of employment right out of college. It has trained me very well
This is a great company.  They truly believe in their employees.  There is always room for advancement, and they strongly believe in cross-training.Everyone was supportive and very pleasant to work with.
ProsGreat Benefits, Work and Life balanceConsNone I can think of
It was difficult to join such a big company virtually. I'm incredibly grateful for my support network that EY assigns us because I feel like there are people outside of my team I can lean on.
ProsBenefitsConsLong hours
EY can be a tough place to work, but the training and mentorship opportunities are top notch. I have grown so much in my time at EY thanks to formal and informal training and development opportunities.
"The job upon starting was great!  I quickly learned (inside of 6 months) that the person I was primarily supporting did not like me.  Never came to me directly; went to admin Manager.  The training did not set me up for success; definitely for failure.  I didn't know what I didn't know.. Definitely people working there that were untouchable and some of the most challenging people to work with (these people were in administrative positions - NOT EXECUTIVES!).  Literally, had to gift folks in certain position to help me do my job.  I was dumb-founded.  High-level and visible position and was trained for two weeks.  The person who trained received a promotion and just wanted to move on.  I did have a mentor but because we didn't really relate to one another (culturally different), a waste of time.  But the person was able to use that as credit to them working and being a team player.  I was told I did not engage enough by admin manager... If I work with you one on one why go to someone outside of the  group.  I was encouraged to be ""too friendly"" and it was something I failed at miserably...mainly because I don't have the knack of being fake.  Was moved to a different department.  Worked out much better. However, it was lower tier and it literally was like crabs in a bucket.  cliques and favorites.  If you are not a big social person you have to navigate very carefully.  Meaning; be everything to everybody.  Just wanted to do job and go home.  Others opinions of you became a part of your review and led to fake chats and ""Hi's & Byes"".   you could be interrupted a gazillion times - more..."
ProsLots of food and snacks, great perks, good payConswork life balance, terrible communication, too much bureaucracy
Culture and ability to grow really stands out at EY. You’re always challenged and will have support to help you succeed. Best coworkers you’ll ever have. Pay at the senior manager level salary wise is comparable to market however loses out to industry with equity and bonus (assurance)
ProsInteresting workConsWork life balance can be a struggle
Typical audit firm culture, long hours during busy season and your experience will vary depending on the team you are placed with. Clients usually have unreasonable deadlines so stressful meeting them.
Best work experience for me.  A great team including partner. Interested in my development. Most partners have an open door policy unlike other Big 4 firms.
ProsCulture, benefitsConsWork-life-balance but this is to be expected at most accounting firms
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
Difficult environment. If a person is in favor by a higher up, they advance, regardless of whether they deserve it. A month after I started, I was told that I was never going to get promoted bc they already had too many people at a certain band level - this is directly opposite of what the “culture” supports.
Challenging work and fast paced environment. While I have learned a lot, I so not believe the compensation is adequate for the work being done and the hours required. 
ProsFree lunchesConsLong hours without overtime pay
Your experience truly depends on what team you get onto and if you are are a minority. If you have great teammates  and the project is not understaffed, then you are lucky
ProsBenefits, PerksConsOverworked, teammates, No work/life balance
Work life balance can be spotty at times but it's what you would expect at a big 4. Hours can be long but coworkers are cool. Lots of free food. Get ready for OT.
Lots of work and lots of learning but it almost felt like a clique that you had to break into. If you didn’t have the right people on your side, then you would likely get the bad/unwanted assignments.
Great organization!Leadership supportive!Work - life balance is manageableSeveral opportunities available given the size of the firmAwesome colleagues
I've been only here for about a year and half. But so far its been great. Hardly get any sleep. But when you take days off, it balances out. Great benefits, minority inclusion, and overall great professional people to work with. 
The people at EY are great and very supportive. If you do well, they'll just work you harder but not compensate you better, which is frustrating. The good staffs and seniors tend to leave. There's a lack of transparency in covid times between senior leadership and the workers.
ProsCompany has good perks - travel, benefits, expense policy.ConsNot compensated well. The good people leave as you go up in the levels.
If you are in audit practice, you will be overworked and underpaid. It is just a nature of the beast. Busy season is unbearable and if you are on a difficult client, you may work 55 hours all year. Trying to switch departments will be met with resistance no matter if you are a high performer. Lots of micromanagers and nobody cares if you are stressed. 
ProsFree dinners and cab rides during busy seasonConsEverything you can think of
There is no work/life balance at all. They make you work an insane amount of hours.There is no rationale to compensation. It's all about when and how you enter the firm. You could be a senior making $70,000 while there's a senior on your team doing the same exact things you're doing but making $80,000 because they transferred from another firm or signed their contract at a different time
ProsBenefitsConsEverything
EY used to be a great place to work, in terms of the job itself, purpose, and coworkers. That is, until they started laying off the support services in waves. Now many of those teams are staffed by offshore contractors. Gone are the dedicated employees with 15+ years at EY- all that knowledge, connections within other teams, experience- GONE. Replaced with people who just respond 'out of scope', limited knowledge of company and its teams, and no ownership.
Prospay, work/life balanceConsmass layoffs within services teams
Great job to learn a lot of information quickly, though that generally means you're constantly busy. Expect to work long and stressful hours during the first 3 months of the year. Management is generally good but its dependent on particular teams so sometimes it can be hard to adjust to different management styles when switching engagements.Best part of the job is that most of the staff/analysts are similar in age so its easy to make decent friends at work.
Work-life balanceWork-life balance at EY is, it’s a big 4 public accounting firm you know what you’re getting into when you decide to work in public accounting. Having said that I’m on a wonderful team that values flexibility an ensures you’re taking the time you need.Pay & benefitsMy pay and benefits at EY are above average. I had offers from EY and another big 4 after graduating. EY exceeded the other company by $5k.Job security and advancementIn terms of job security at EY, I think it’s a little scary right now with corona. I think I will feel more secure once/if corona is under control. As for advancing there is an abundance of opportunities to grow within the organization.ManagementIn general, managers at EY are awesome. When I interned my senior taught me more in those three months than I learned in the entire time I was in school. Now that I’m full time staff I’m with a different senior manager who even though busy takes time to meet with me an ensure everything is going well.CultureCollaboration with my colleagues at EY is great. They’re super helpful for a new staff like me. Even being remote they jump on calls/share screens etc.OverallMy experience working at EY so far it’s been great. I enjoy the culture and having the feeling that people want me to succeed
Pressure deadlines lot of work. Too much work and no work life balance. Very strict performance appraisals. The first impression lasts for a very long time

Loved my time working at EY.  Interesting work, great people, solid support. Technology is a little bit old and hours could be long.  But overall a fantastic experience
Obviously depended on service line but often you are overworked and underpaid. You learn a ton but it doesn’t always feel like it is worth it. I have had some great teams and some not so great teams. 
EY can really be an amazing or horrible experience. It depends on the projects you get staffed on. They can either be amazing and develop you. Or sometimes they can be stressful and limiting 
I did enjoy my time at EY. As I’m sure every workplace has, there are pros and cons. I’d say the pros consist of competitive pay, some supportive people, firm-sponsored resources, and clear promotion trajectory. The cons consist of constant stress regarding making or exceeding utilization goals - this is out of your control as a staff and senior and oftentimes comes down to you having to politic to get onto enough revolving projects. Leadership is not transparent and people seem a bit cliquey. I’d say to find two to three people (managers) who will vouch for you and routinely add you to all of their engagements to meet / exceed your utilization quota. 
ProsPay, people, promotion pathConsLack of transparency, stress due to billable hourly requirements
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
This is the best place to start your career. You learn so much and can easily parlay your experience here into fantastic industry jobs. Know that you will be working long hours at times, but the Company is great about letting you take your time off during the slower periods. I'd highly recommend at least getting a taste of the Big 4 experience!
Management does not seem to care about development of younger resources. I have been working for numerous managers who give me positive feedback, yet we are not compensated accordingly and am nervous about job security.
I loved working there, until it was rumored our jobs were possibly going to be eliminated.  I didn't want to wait to be let go, so I found new employment.  No one ended up being let go in the end. Many of my friends still work there and love it.  No one that I know of has been let go due to COVID, so that really says something about the firm.  They are solid and care about their employees.
ProsGood insurance.
This is a very busy company to work for with low compensation and not great work life balance. But the opportunity for growth and advancement is amazing. And you will learn a ton while there.
ProsGrowth, opportunity, learningConswork life balance and compensation
You'll get a lot of experience from working with different people as well as different industries. The biggest downside is the terrible work life balance you get. You will more than likely be working more than you are expecting to.
ProsBenefits, Pto, career progressionConsPoor work/life balance, below average pay
Great people, heavy workload, poor work/life balance - at least this is my experience in the audit practice. However, as everyone says, it is truly a great launch if moving up the ranks in a company (EY or not) is what you want to do. Over the year I worked here, I just discovered it's not what I want out of life.
ProsPeople, perks, developmentConsWork load, work/life balance
"EY is a great place to join straight out of college or after a lengthy career in consulting.  However, if you are an experienced professional who has not worked for Big 4, prepare to be thrown into the deep end with very little guidance.   Simple things like ""who is on my team"", ""where does my team sit"", ""where do i find basic resources for my job in sharepoint/company intranet"" are going to be a struggle.  There is a peer counseling program in name only.  I had one phone call with my peer counselor 3 months after I joined the firm, and most people I spoke to had similar experiences when they joined.  There is a MAJOR learning curve and you are expected to navigate this process largely on your own.   Your success will be entirely determined by currying favor with the appropriate partners who will protect you and steer you towards meaningful projects.  If you don't cultivate these relationships with partners, you will be floating adrift with no direction and no client work to do.  For a career consultant, EY is a solid option, for others stop and consider what you really want out of your next job."
ProsGreat pay and benefitsConsNo guidance, very political, heavy handed administration that makes it difficult to do anything without jumping through 50 hoops
Toxic work culture. Benefits and pay were pretty good. Too many hours and the expectation of nights and weekends means they get to take over your life whenever they feel like it.
Great people to work with. Supportive team. Work is sometimes interestinG. Pay is not great. Might need to work long hours depending on the project you’re on. 
A little old fashioned and rigid.  Typical Accounting firm personalities.  The BU I supported was short staffed and most HRBP's were overworked and unhappy.
I interned and took a full time position for after graduation. Was very impressed with the magnitude of our projects and c-suite interaction. Definitely felt professional and important. Got to do some abnormal “consulting” engagements where I more so talked with management and served as a project manager. EY is constantly rebranding their practices in order to appeal to the latest and greatest trends, but none of the work changes for us. One of my biggest pet peeves was they would hire people from other Big 4’s and pay them 15-20% more than what we loyal employees make. When COVID-19 hit, we were told there would be no layoffs. This was reiterated multiple times. All of our trainings were online this year (average cost per person savings of at least $3-4K), we didn’t lose too much work (still had $11B of revenue), yet they cut all bonuses and raises. Oh and then they decide to donate millions of dollars to historically black colleges/universities right as they cut our bonuses! The following week were told we can go to the march on Washington and not have to charge vacation, and EY would pay for anyone’s flight who wanted to go! Morale was at an all time low after 3 years. Don’t know how they have the money for all of this but not enough to take care of their loyal, hard-working employees.Then out of the blue I get a call and let’s me know that I’m fired and have 2 more days at the firm. OUT OF THE BLUE. They claimed performance issues but they fired a lot of seniors across the country. They fired every senior on the two projects I was on, as well as a manager. 
ProsMassive companyConsPolitically correct, liberal firm, zero work/life balance, you’ll work like a dog and not make nearly enough money
In general a good company with many people who work hard and want to do the right thing. There are some bad actors, and many people who get ahead not on merit, but based on their connections in the firm. Rumor is that some preference given to those from the same immigrant groups based on a very unscientific study.
ProsSalary is decentConsLow bonus, promotions are not merit based
I feel like my job is secure and there’s a lot of opportunity for growth. However I don’t feel like I am compensated fairly for my work, and my work is not very meaningful 
Ppl wouldn’t show up on time and then would call out 3 hours later. Constant running around (which helped me lose weight) but when there is only 1 elevator for 1500 ppl in the same building was frustrating so I had to use the stairs and the building was 20 stories tall. No accountability so everyone was pointing fingers at everyone else. 
ProsFree foodConsHad to pay for parking-even as a temp when I 1st started
During my time with the firm I was able to gain a tremendous amount of knowledge and first hand experience with a wide variety of professional services. It was a fantastic learning experience and feel fortinute for my time I was able to have with firm.
A great place to work with great clients but don't expect anything but a lot of stress.The technologies used make it harder to get your work done which is frustrating many times.
My position at allowed me to use a vast array of skills from design to programming.  I am heartbroken that the reason it's over was due to COVID-19 affecting the company financially.  Contractors, in any organization, tend to be the first to be let go.  Still, I wouldn't trade my time there for anything.
EY does a good job of convincing you that you should stay until manager; however, there is no one ensuring that you are set up for success after a certain point. Get in, make senior, get OUT! 
ProsGood exposureConsNo work life balance
One year in, and I want out. I was sold on the idea of being a consultant with the firm, and being staffed on fun and interesting projects, however, it feels like I'm only being staffed on repetitive audits that drag on forever. 
Managers lie about expectations.  You will be a salesperson rather than actually delivering technical expertise to your client.  You will always have to sell instead of actually consulting.
ProsNoneConsLying management
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
"Pros: Good pay, great vacation, good raises each year based on firm performance, and most everyone at your level is of similar age which is nice Cons: Can be stressful, busy season is always a struggle, and many times you feel unimportant/easily replaceable"
I found that depending on the team and the management of the team dictates your work/life balance and whether you have to deal with bad upper-level management, and be at risk of running an engagement with no support and having your management pin their mistakes on you to save their unsecured jobs seeing EY has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs in the past couple years and put the work culture on egg shells. EY needs to get it together, otherwise you’ll see a lot of people leave; note, I’ve heard from many people seeking other employment from EY. Good luck to all. 
ProsBenefits, CompensationConsPoor local office leadership / Inexperienced upper level management
I loved working at EY and having it on my resume.  In the end, though, I’m not interested in finance or tax or accounting so I left for something more fulfilling.  Great colleagues - smart, ethical, dedicated
ProsReputation, compensation, training, reaourcesConsThe subject matter did not inspire me
Put in your time, make senior then leave unless you plan to stay and make partner. Winners are losers here because you almost always have to pick up other people's work. People are still getting promoted regardless of low performance and high performers are paid very little more than low performers which makes all the great people leave. No guidance, no appreciation whatsoever!!! It is ALL about the budget and margin and you will be forced to eat hours without being told so directly. Moreover, if you are bad luck, you will be put on the worst client and stuck there or working under manager who is lazy and belittles fellow employee. 
ProsDiversity, resume builder, flexibility, challenging work, great learning curveConsLong hours, bad management, toxic work environment, and pay is way below market
It's hard to find a better place to start an accounting career in financial services. You will gain all the knowledge you want and then some. The work is also interesting and rewarding. Unfortunately work/life balance is non-existent. This is made tolerable by some flexibility, but you'll still be averaging 80 hours a week in both busy seasons. Co-workers are great, and the culture is pretty darn good. It ultimately makes the job bearable. How long you are willing to work the hours will ultimately dictate how long you choose to stay with the firm. The longer you can hold out, the better your future.
The workplace culture is inclusive and supportive.  Leadership stands for equality and that tone at the top is executed locally.  The people make this place great.
ProsCompensation is excellentConsWork life balance is a challenge
Worked at 2 of the biggest consultancies, would never return to EY.  Partners only look out for themselves.  Politics over productivity.  EY talks technology, but doesn't do technology.
ProsTrue partner modelConsBack stabbing
I worked as a temp EA from Nov '18 to Mar '19.  I loved working for EY.  The job, people & mgrs were great.  I was hopeful it would become permanent, but sadly it did not.  I will DEF apply if/when the right job is posted.
ProsThe people, work, appreciation.ConsI was not included/invited to their big holiday bash. Full disclosure? I would not have even gone, but being left out made me feel awful & unappreciated. But I got over it.
Now security director is a wonderful person he will work with you the people above him not so much. Sometimes you're called to do things that are not in your job description and you'll put up with a lot more things for so little pay (thus the people above security director)also a lot of drama having to do with the people you work with often they are slackers with nasty attitudes but some coworkers are the complete opposite and will work well with youand will work well with you
ProsGreat for experience; good working environment to a degree!ConsThe higher-ups are usually known to be very cheap, they also frequently conduct different contracts with management, a lot of times because they don't want to come out of pocket more than they have to, Their motto the cheaper the better!
It was good environment, friendly, I learned a lot. Ey is one of four top accounting firm, it has its work culture. Big firm require a lot of work hours, management ask a lot of your time, overtime.
EY's people are amazing. They all want to see you succeed. The pay could be better though. They really do not take into account the cost of living in certain cities.
EY, probably similar to other Big 4 firms, has so many tools, talent, and experience at your fingertips. I was able to see large and small clients with groundbreaking technology next to the brightest in my field. I would 100% go back to work with them.
Great firm, some of the best years in my career.  The culture, compensation, and opportunity to grow were  outstanding.  Client assignments were Fortune 200.
Great place to work. Excellent co-worker. This company is about helping the employees and customer(s). We may be slow sometimes and to keep us working, we are assigned projects to keep us working. I really appreciate this due to the time like this. Awesome place to work.
If you work hard and have a keen and creative style you will succeed at E Y. Most importantly the staff, as well as the partners collaborate to provide the highest level of effort to meet the needs of the clients at every level of service provided, tax and audit  personal working together to anticipate and satisfy said clients needs.
Speaking strictly from an experienced EA's point of view, unless you are young and single, advancement in your top administrative role is simply too congested with talent to secure a promotion into another role without relocating and/or shifting job responsibilities. In other words, an EY EA has few upward advancement opportunities unless they shift into a different field and are willing to relocate. This may not work well for those with working career spouses, or young children in schools where they are thriving. Eventually, you get the sense from EY that you need to seek advancement as the years go by or get left behind in favor of those that can easily relocate and grow in different career paths.
ProsVirtual assistance experience; Company stabilityConsFew opportunities for growth in a densely competitive arena
"Wide ranging services and top notch people.Plenty of opportunities in Departmental, client, executive communications: writing, editing, presentations, graphics, web"
ProsFlexibilityConsWasn’t there long enough to find real cons
The pay is very low compared to many other consulting firms. However, it is a good place to come to right out of college to gain experience. Just don’t stay for long, there’s so advancement really.
ProsGreat work environmentConsLow pay
There are no free rides at EY...everyone is expected to bring their A game everyday and they are expected to pull their weight.  There are no cutting corners and if you keep your head down and do well you will go far.
ProsPaid Leave (maternity and paternity)ConsLong hours, sometimes often unappreciated
good company, the culture isn't good among the team. it is a sweatshop really. they expect alot of work. I wouldn't go back i did not enjoy it. it was okay.
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
"I was thrilled to start my internship until I got there.  My team was rude, we were told don't tell the senior manager of any problems or he will scream for hours. My team did not take time to teach me, they would get frustrated if my work took too long, and would blow up my phone by 12pm on Saturday asking why my weekend work was not completed yet.  During the time of my internship I was never given any feedback until the last day when I was told my ""work has not improved at all over the course of your internship"" even though I constantly asked questions and did what I could to succeed.  They told me I did not receive a job offer because my work was not quality, as an intern I'm not too sure what they could have expected from me. Overall it was a letdown and disappointment.  I was not given the tools or support to succeed and they blamed that on me.  Everyone there is miserable and hates their job.  My manager said ""don't drink they EY Kool-AID"" and I have to agree.  Do not waste your time."
"Busy season is crazy. But you have a lot smart people you can learn stuff from. However, high performers are actually being punished as they are being taken between different engagements and even during summer time."
ProsLearning and trainingConslong hours
Ernst & Young is a company that promote cultural diversity as well as fomenting a good teamwork environment. It also promotes a flexible work environment as well as promoting a work/life balance.
Working in public accounting anywhere is going to require long hours but you will be rewarded with opportunity and great pay/benefits. The challenging work and breadth of experience is worthwhile but you may find yourself looking for better work/life balance after a few years.
Great place to gain work experience As a professional, I have extensive experience in Business Transformation which includes Program/Project Management, Relationship Management, Process Improvement, Technology and Performance Management.
"Pros: Big 4 branding to carry with for a lifetime. Good trainingsCons: Really depends on your reporting manager/leader. Overall some great minds to work alongside. Stretch hours during peak times of the engagement."
Great place to work and build a career.  Friendly people and flexible working environment.  Compensation is good.  Hours are heavy in busy season but this is to be expected in public accounting.
Slow progress within the rank and career advancement. People who has previous related experience were not appreciated by the company, who worked hard did not get promoted as they should.
I love this company because of their investment in people and culture. But the work environment can be toxic as people gossip too much and you often feel like people are competing with each other rather than supporting each other.
You will work long hours at ey. They do not have a work life balance but some of the perks of working there are nice- ljke meals, entertainment etc. some of the managers on engagements are not good managers.
I love, love, love this job! It could of definitely been a long time career. It has so much flexibility and opportunities to work from home. A team of like minded individuals to work with.
I worked with a great set of individuals. I I learned how to audit both private and public clients. The workplace culture was laid back but professional.
Great Culture and People. Ability to learsn and improve as a leader. EY provides that flexible environment. I was able to utilize what I learned and implement changes to improve the services we provided
Good company to work for, excellent pay and good benefits... The come is pretty strict but expect excellent in each employees..  Plus the management team has a good open door policy...
"Hard to move around the practice Great starting job  Huge security and learn how to audit a company inside and out Lots of travel (if you get a client outside of new york)"
Though the experience is significant and benefits are great, as with any public accounting role you will be worked to the bone and find your life taken over by the job.
Great place to start your career. Very fast paced work environment. You'll learn a ton in a short period of time and gain plenty of exposure with executives and other accounting/finance personnel of your clients.  Must be motivated and resilient as some days will be tougher than others and busy season can wear you down if you don't have the right (positive) attitude day in and day out.
If you would like to work as a consultant on a variety of projects, then EY is a good place to work.  It offers a variety of job opportunities for people in the early to mid-career moves.
EY is a nice place to work because it offers the freedom to forge your own career path, but you must be patient and build your network and your brand.
I have had a lot of different jobs.  Some were good and some were bad. Ey was bad and the moth ruthless at attempting to save money by squeezing the workers as much as possible.  It is the epitome of an evil corporation.
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
It provide opportunities to work and balance life. It is great to work with team. But decision making and process follow up allows you to groom and progress with in company.
A place where you definitely will learn about your job and to succeed rapidly.  I always had support by my direct reports and even people from other departments.
"This company wasn't perfect, but it's about as close as you can get!  I honestly felt that they had confidence in the abilities of each and every one of their employees, which means a lot!   The only thing I hated were the politics!!  In fact, my stay was very short because of it.  Our whole team was disbanded because of it."
ProsI love Work Life Balance! Also, they treat you like a valuable professional.ConsPolitics
Invaluable experience at a top accounting firm. Unforgettable management and invested co-workers help create a dynamic and challenging work environment.
You have to be willing to put in a lot of hours and demanding workload as this is a fast pace firm. Fostered a team environment and provided opportunities to learn additional skills
"Great company to work with , Its like dream come true working with EY.Working with EY required 24 Hrs working & we can learn a lot there, There are an immense opportunities ."
I have had a fulfilling career over the past twelve years with EY. Their inclusive work culture is exemplary. They gave me opportunities to learn and grow as a financial analyst' to become a leader and an educator in addition to a successful analyst. I am very grateful for their contribution to my professional growth
EY fostered a strong culture of smart, driven and productive professionals that are committed to growing within the firm and giving back to the company and community as a whole.
"The project lasted for much shorter time than expected.The staff was rude & not cooperative.The nature of the work was not stimulatingThe company in general was good but the department I worked was not up to mark"
This company goes above and beyond to provide a good workplace culture.  The people are friendly and make sure you have everything you need to succeed.
Good place to build upon introductory skills as a new college graduate; not so much for experienced hires, unless you've established yourself within the firm by playing the long game(4+ years). Be methodoical about your personal goals and keep to yourself as much as humanly possible. Think really hard about who you trust, as many are willing to railroad your tragectory to get ahead of you.
"Pro- work with great people and great clients- set career path with the firm with promotion opportunities  Negatives- not great for business currently - work life balance could be a lot better- not a cohesive firm and operates as many small business"
Very productive. Productive work environment with ping pong table. A lot of free coffee. You will be surprised by how much coffee you can drink there for free.
The EY environment provides a balanced but challenging atmosphere in which an individual can actively succeed and thrive, whilst simultaneously advancing their career.
ProsFree Lunches, long lunch break, great teamsConslong hours, stressful at times
"Great company with a great brand.  Lots of outdated policies which restrict promotion.  Company doesn't value previous experience as part of ""experience"".  Experienced hire seldom get hired into leadership roles."
EY does not appreciate the employees. Instead of helping and giving constructive advice they (she) was quit to put you down as well as talk down like everyone was incompetent
You are able to build a solid network if you are on project based engagements, but being that it is a large company, you do feel (at times) like you are just a number.
I worked and commuted to my client projects at least 80%, and often spent weeks abroad.  Benefits were solid, and we were able to take care of our team members who delivered above and beyond expectations.
"Confidential environment but great place to work.Intense enviroment att times but can get compensated airly for it.Flexible work arrengements for those who need it."
From February 2014 to may 2018 working at ey has been a great experience. The amout of care, the Determination  they have for innovation is beyond certain business standards. Working at ey has mad a positive impact in my life. Employees want to see you suceed, and the supervisors want the best for you and nothing less.
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
Hours can be brutal and compensation is not great for entry level - middle management. Advancement is almost guaranteed so long as that the individual is qualified and performing.
I have been working at EY for a little under a year and I have mixed feelings about it. Your experience varies greatly depending on what team you are assigned to and how you get along with the people on that team. During normal hours even a bad team can be bearable, but when busy season hits, you do NOT want to be stuck with people who you don't get along with for 13 hours a day 6-7 days a week. The salary is alright, but during busy season you are essentially getting paid minimum wage at the entry level positions. Perk-wise not bad, but nothing to write home about. Overall, I would only recommend this job if you really want the experience and EY brand on your resume, otherwise this is just a pit of despair and sadness.
"I enjoyed working for EY, and I have worked for other Big4's in the past. I had a pretty laid back schedule for most of the year, and the opportunity to work from home when needed to. My director was my favorite person in the world, however one of the managers had a ""micro-managing"" personality, which was not productive. That manager would be more worried about what other people were doing than getting their own work done, which evidently lead to many of us having to work late to help them finish during the busy season. This was definitely the ""hardest"" part of the job - dealing with different personalities. Sometimes you get good bosses, and sometimes you don't - it comes with the territory."
Proswork from home options, good benefits, family environment
EY focuses a lot on identity politics, leadership supports the group that's in and won't other minority groups within the organization. Hispanics are look down upon and sometimes feel leadership would prefer you to clean toilets. Racial tension is in an all-time high, I blame leadership for allowing that to happen.  Hostile environment by management.
ProsNoneConsEverything
Company is very biased and there is no support from seniors, if you land yourself with a wrong counselor your career at EY is over, also counselor does not guide
The key here is networking to find better opportunities or you’ll fall into a trap. They also tend to take advantage of hard workers and respect people willing to play politics; understandably so, since this IS a corporate environment, afterall. Compensation is awful and the people getting paid more tend to lack competency and good judgement but are somehow expected to lead the team.
A great place to continue to learn - whether specializing in certain industries or navigating through challenging client or internal engagements. Generally, you are given support. But if you give them an inch, management will take a mile if you don't stand your ground.
"Learning is accelerated and extremely fast-paced; however, hours are typically long, even during the ""slow"" months. The people are the best part of this job. The team environment is great. I would recommend this job to any college graduate with an accounting/finance degree."
Friendly coworkers, and work environment. This job entails a lot of on-the-job learning and improvising as the majority of work done within this position depends on client circumstances and quick deadlines. Not much can be learned in this position for employees out of college.
Success awaits those that are willing to sacrifice and put in the time and effort and be at the beck and call of clients and senior leaders. This lifestyle is not for everyone but for those that can tolerate it, the path is usually fairly straightforward.
The people at EY are very friendly. My coworkers are willing to help. They have a mentoring process to help you grow throughout your career. They have an open door policy.
Overall EY offers flexible environment, they have in placed high tech tool and most modern work spaces. my experience was good with management and offers a lot of learning opportunities
I have definitely learned a lot during my ten week internship. I got to work in different engagements and grasp a great sense of teamwork and culture at big 4.
The benefits are awesome; consequently, the pathway to excel for Core Business Service employees has not been designed. The workday is fulfilling and many opportunities are available to learn. The company sternly promotes work-life balance.
Do not believe the awful things you hear about working for the Big 4. Vibrant work environment; great people. Ability to office from home. Good opportunities.
ProsRegular snacksConsLong hours
EY is highly competitive, highly skilled and ambitious organization. A typical day at EY lasts for about 10-12 hours. Fridays are work from home. I would recommend EY to anyone who is fit, ambitious and wants to grow fast in consulting.
Like many Big4 firms, you will learn a lot of technical, management, and high level business skills that will offer excellent exit opportunities. The quarterly training is phenomenal.
"Very diverse employment base.Leadership changes often.You are in charge of your career advancement.Very competitive internally.Teams have loyalty to each other."
"The company has a good work life balance and encourage people to speak out.  We also build relationship by doing the right thing.The hardest part of the job is meeting tight deadlines"
My  view of EY is rather screwed because I worked remotely and our tenure there was only 8 months due to a departmental lay-off.  With that being said, I was impressed with the positive and supportive attitude of that firm! I from the peer counselor assigned to me, to the constant effort to provide information and education that would enhance my experience as an employee and growth as a professional.
Was not told my objectives throughout the summer and as a result I didn’t receive an offer back. My internship experience was also kind of boringGood people and good company
A great workplace culture. Every day is filled with new tasks. Management is very outgoing and always willing to help. I learned a lot of accounting software.
Good company to work for, Im happy with EY and for the opportunity. Excellent benefits and compensation. Very good and flexible with working hours. Outstanding employer.
An excellent work place filled with knowledgeable and helpful managers. Completely diverse and inclusive environment. Work life balance is superb and very big respect for family.
The hardest part of the job is the long hours, adapting to the fast pace of work and adapting to the many different work styles that you will come across through each assurance team.
"Typical Day, finish the job ""under budget"". Lack of communication lead to inefficiencies. You learn a lot from team members closer to your level then management"
A typical work day for me consist of 8 Hour days, Inspecting property on the base. Verifying documentation on each assets. Taking clear photos of the asset to show facility usage. Giving feedback to to correct any deficiencies.
EY is what you would expect from a big 4 firm. You travel weekly for the most part to do consulting for various clients. When you are not traveling, it can be flexible.
"- Good place to learn as you work with lots of clients over your time there- Lack of work life balance, not just during peak season- Lots of business trips"
EY is a great company to work for, however the flexibility with the company has changed and i am unable to travel the distance (worked from home). I feel I can be an asset with another company with lateral moves.
The people are very clique.  If you didn't grow up in that environment, it's different and it's hard to get into it unless you come in as a senior manager or higher
EY has a long history of litigation by employees, so much so they now require everyone to sign an arbitration agreement. They hire and fire en masse, with litttle regard for individuals. It's a revolving door, despite what the company claims in the many training videos you will be required to watch. I was part of a group where all the women were fired because the company could not obtain enough work. Less competent and experienced males were retained. The workplace was filthy. Jobs are offshored at every opportunity.
EY GDS will pay you well and provide wfh benefits and all. But the real trouble here comes in the people management part because the expectation is no matter what time of the day it is , how many hours you have worked you need to give the work asap
This is a good place to work and develop with many interesting, smart and confident people around. It's hard to keep a work life balance as work load is high.
"The firm's work environment is not in alignment with how they present themselves to the world. Especially if you are a POC. The firm habitually has a hard time maintaining these employees and it's for good reason. POC are often over looked for opportunities, unless they have straight hair, blonde hair, or a British accent. You'll notice how the firm loves to parade Eurasian women and leave out those who cannot ""pass."" And the only non-Eurasians the firm is concerned with are those they can put on display to show how ""inclusive"" they are... even if that inclusion is 1 individual. This place is a fallacy and I would not recommend working here."
This is a good place to grow and work with large client portfolio. At some points rewards become less than costs and lots of people leave the company, which is why it has very high turnover rate
EY takes an innovative approach to hiring contract employees -- they have a dedicated hiring team and a website (gignow.com) just for contract hires. Everyone I interacted with was very professional, helpful, friendly.
EY has a fast paced, challenging work environment. You are constantly learning from others and simultaneously coaching those after you. I worked on a great team that was flexible and encouraging.
I do not choose to disclose this information. I do not wish to disclose my experience at this organization. As I am simply looking to apply for roles for where my experience would be essential and seen as a valuable asset.
Being a virtual executive assistant is very different. I serve eight executives most of which are on the west coast. Booking travel, submitting time and expenses and arranging meetings are a typical day for me.
El único problema fue el área donde laboraba, por su naturaleza era de mucho trabajo y por ende se tenía que sacrificar el tiempo libre y no por culpa de los líderes de área sino por los mismos compromisos con nuestros clientes; por lo demás un excelente ambiente, condiciones de trabajo, metodología para ejecutar extraordinario.
