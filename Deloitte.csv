Was my first job or if college.  Good start.  Good n name to launch into other areas.  Go into consultant if you don't know what you want to do to get experience 
It's a great place ti wire with lots of opportunities and you get to work with a different amount of people on projects and everyone is wonderful to work with
Great way of doing this and then it erased me out to the library. Let me see if we believe they will not. The problem is we get to do the same time ⏲️ as a symbol that is still 
It’s really a good company. Good work culture. The technology they work in is little old but overall good place to work for. The perks are really nice and people here are good.
This was a great opportunity. I ended up leaving because I don't want to work 45+ hours a week. Considering it's a Big Four, I know it's not surprising. People are experienced and professional. Managers are very approachable. Networking is important. I worked on government projects for GPS, and in a talent model called USDC. I think USDC is a great way to get in, it's not as hard as traditional consulting. It means you just work on projects, don't need to submit proposals to clients. 
ProsGreat benefits. Good people to work with.ConsThey want at least 45 hours a week
Working at Deloitte was a great experience. I felt very supported by everyone around me and the culture was very different from what I expected in the best ways

Deloitte is a good launchpad for starting your career after graduating from college, but the company has a very competitive environment that isn’t for everyone.
Very professional and generally good corporate culture. Great office. Generally nice people to work with. Demanding work environment with constant deadlines. 
It’s a fabulous place to start your career.  However, once you make senior manager, really evaluate your odds of making partner.  It depends a lot on connections, not just client satisfaction or even ability to sell work.  If partner is unlikely, don’t stay - jump ship to industry.
Salary is average. Increment given is not good. People working on 2 projects and people on bench get same increment. Salary is average. Increment given is not good.
Internship was a lot of fun. Great interns and people. Did not get to see alot of the work being done. Heard scary stories about busy season. Met amazing people.
Big 4, great place to start your career but hours are long and not for everyone.  Worked 100 billable a few weeks during busy season and 55 for the remainder 
Understaffed in several positions I had, overbearing manager in one of those positions. A good amount of complaining, pay scale is hidden from people, you could be making much less than someone in the same role. There is a lot of opportunity if you can network properly, chances to learn and be included. Many leave and come back to have more competitive pay

Great work life balance. Enjoy my time there. Opportunity for growth within the company. Great benefits and caring staff as well. Would highly recommend 
Great company with excellent managers that are fair-minded.  They care about their clients and are passionate in serving them.  I learned a great deal working there
Coming from Industry corporate finance and integrating into a big 4 consulting firm was a culture shock. The role did not have a formal training program but a sink or swim approach to indoctrination. The culture was very dependent on your client team as each leader ran it like their own business. This is a back office role that doesn't have ability to move to other opportunities within the firm. 
Good place to work and wonderful culture. Except extended work hours during delivery times but at same time you can pace your work life balance. Pay is good and learning is amazing
Fast paced, young corporate environment. Good to start career from. Benefits were ok, workhours long. Flexible working environment.Recommended for career start.

Overall a great place to work. A little too corporatey in recent years. Good place to grow. Great opportunities but pay is quite low compared to the average. Benefits are as expected - excellent.
I'm a little different from most other consultants. I've been working under a talent model (USDC) that allows for decent hours, working on government projects. So I didn't have to work terrible hours. But they still pressure you to do 45+ hours a week. Call me lazy, but I want to do 40 hours and no more. My main reason for leaving is the government project I'm at now. Government sucks, so much bureaucracy. So it's less about Deloitte, but anyway I don't see a ton of projects for what I do (data engineering). So I'm gonna go back to the private sector. People have been nice, really experienced and professional. They encourage networking. Senior managers are pretty available to talk. 
Love the company. There is a lot of opportunity to grow and build experience while at this Big 4 accounting firm. Also super friendly staff, do pay attention to work life balance
ProscompensatuinConswork life balance easy to forget
Hard job with experience varying wildly depending on the project and team you're staffed on. Some managers great and others are harder to work with frequently. 
Great company to work for. Managers are very motivating and want you to succeed.  Also, company emphasizes a lot on the wellbeing of the employee. I feel blessed!!!
ProsA lot of online courses and certificates than can give great opportunities in the near future, projects are pretty cool and challenging and salary is great too!ConsSometimes I have to work long hours depending on client's needs, but if you make the effort you will always learn something new
The team really supports you through the process.  The tasks are really informative and you get valuable skillset. Compensation standard for internship 
Great way to gain experience. Training was good, but could have been more structured & focused. Several opportunities to do several different types of work across a wide spectrum of industries.
Lack of guidlines and training. Busy season year round due to staff shotage. Busy season is no longer from Jan to April. Assigned 10+ eyeryday plus weekend working 
Work remote, you are treated like a second class citizen. Overall good company but not alot of government  projects to choose from.  Hard to get promoted or raises once you work for the company.
You can learn anything you want by voicing yourself. But please expect long long working hours, stressful timeline, partner might not show appreciation. 
Long hours for a compliance role. Every quarter we got super busy. If you like different types of project this role isn't it. I highly suggest looking at other teams within Deloitte. 
ample opportunities for growth and development, but you'll need to be comfortable charting your own career path. Management is very team dependent; some not so good, but mostly really good leaders.
Every day is different with something interesting to do. Deloitte offers a plethora of paid training, including online options, that you can take advantage of outside of normal work hours as well as during work. However, too much training will impact your utilization numbers which are important to be retained and promoted.
It’s a good place to start a career. Hours will be longer at the beginning of the year up to March. They help with getting your CPA so that’s good as well.
Great professional services firm.  Quality is required and expected which results in a great work environment.  I have enjoyed my professional career at this firm.
Great company to work for. Great clients, supportive management and a lot of opportunities to grow from a professional and personal point of view. Lots of mentoring programmes as well. 
What is the best part of working at the company?Supportive of many things outside the workplace. Great social responsibilityWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Your vacation is never a paid vacation. You have to work billable work ahead of time in order to meet your billable goals. Paid vacation is a false benefitWhat is the work environment and culture like at the company?Very cutthroat. Prosper across division for joy like working together or sharing accounts. Deloitte consulting generally thinks they are smarter than everyone else What is a typical day like for you at the company?Work early. Work late. Lots of meeting during the day. No time to actually get work done than outside regular hours
I interned in the Summer. There was no work to do and our office never wanted to work in person. So the internship was basically 100% virtual, which was never told to us ahead of time. I asked for work frequently but I was always told they would let me know when they got something. Projects I was assigned to got pushed out of the internship time period. There was no instruction from leadership about our internship program. I was very disappointed overall and are taking opportunities elsewhere. 
ProsGet your own laptop for workCons100% Virtual, No Connections, No work
Nothing special and haven’t learned a lot. Rotational program is kinda wack, nothing that is external marketing all internal which is disappointing for many  
I had an internship there during covid times, it lasted 2 weeks. It was handled as well as it could have been. They prioritized learning in our short time which was helpful.

"Lots of opportunities to grow and learn. Support and Quality of management depends on where you land of course... First time right is true as well as ""up or out"" culture "
The job itself can be a bit repetitive but if you build relationships with your clients, it makes the world of a difference. Decent pay, great PTO, flexible hours, hybrid work model (in office two days) & good opportunity to move within the company. 
My time at Deloitte was perfect. Nothing to complain about. Culture is employee friendly. Fantastic colleagues. Deloitte tries to keep improving its policies and practices constantly.
ProsSupportive cultureConsMight have to work long hours during busy season
Having been at Deloitte for nearly four years, I've come to appreciate the people I work with and the clients that we serve. Each project is different, but knowing that you can own your career in a sense make a big difference over other firms. 
Was hired and told all the things I wanted to hear (Great salary, WFH flexibility, generous PTO, etc). A month after I started I found out a colleague with the exact same certs and experience was making 20k more. Strike 1. WFH flexibility is all but gone. One day max allowed to work from home while managers can work up to 3. It appeared like a glorious opportunity but that all faded very very fast.

I loved my time at Deloitte. The other analysts and peers were fun, sociable, smart and interesting people. Deloitte invests a lot in your development, and trains their managers so that you know you'll be working under someone who has some experience. You usually get to work on important projects for the company.The work can be dry at times, and you will be working longer hours and may have to manage up. Such is the nature of consulting. You also might get stuck on a project you don't love.But, it's a good jumping off point into the world of professional services.
ProsGood mentorship, smart colleagues, training and development, good managementConsLong hours and travel (this was before covid, unclear if it's changed)
I had a horrible experience here. A boss that was lying to leadership and when my research uncovered the facts harassed and bullied me out of a job.I needed 8 weeks of intensive therapy after I left.

What is the best part of working at the company?Great to have on your resume and there are some good staff and leadership, but not everywhere.What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Still an “old boys” network. Stepping on top of coworkers to be seen. Some management use the staff rather than support them.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Often toxic. Supposedly they are trying to change it, but until there is support that all measurements should not be to the white male standard, then I don’t think it will truly change.What is a typical day like for you at the company?My group was 9-5 with the expectation that you would also work at home at night. Not all groups were that easy.
Lots of traveling, almost 4 days per weekday that if you are a person enjoy traveling then definitely would be a perfect role, otherwise if you have a family or you want to settle down a place to live in, then not a good choice.
Pros - Supportive culture - Great management - Flexible working hours Cons - Low compensation - lot of salary overlaps across levelsLocation - India (not US) 
Culture is not good you have to beg for promotion no matter how good you are ,Pay is very less, Noting is good , there are no good projects ,  Environment is bad .  They can keep promoting dumbs if you butter  they can keep ignored superstars/talented if you do not butter
Great work environment and the people are very supportive. With any Big 4, busy season is hectic but manageable. Great benefits and generally flexible PTO 
As a new grad, Deloitte is a great place to start your career so long as you actively grow your skillsets. Use their reimbursement for certifications. At the time of this review, most roles are remote/hybrid. 
ConsFinding a long-term project can be hard. Work-life balance is meh.

ProsLots of travel (before covid)ConsLots of travel...
It's going to be a lot of hard work and long hours that may feel unappreciated as well as an expectation to do so. Being hyper efficient can be detrimental as you will be making up for those that are less efficient. Politics and people that are more interested in managing their career and appearance are unavoidable to the detriment of the company's objectives are plentiful.
Overall a good experience. Management is understanding and helpful. Great work life balance. Everyone is helping in the Team.Frequent HR and team connects.
A lot of arrogant co-workers who believe that they are better than they are. There is a lot of internal politics and there are many layers of seniority that are incomprenhensible other than to stroke the egos of those who have been around for a while. 
Extremely long hours during busy season. People mostly only care about the work, not so much how people are doing. Great career advancement, learning opportunities, and exit opportunities. Benefits are solid.
Deloitte is great if you are a type A career minded ambitious individual. As someone who wanted balance and fun individuals to work with, it was not for me. Definitely for some and not for others.
competition between team members is encouraged, mgmt style is top down, dictatorial. very old school approach. partners and senior managers are always right. 
Great company, great experience, great perks. I love working here and have had great opportunities presented to me to learn, take on more responsibility and grow as a professional.
Worked in R&FA - IT Internal Audit. Cannot say enough about how great the people and the culture is at Deloitte. Everyone is beyond supportive. However, I didn't love my job function and wasn't too thrilled with the pay either. However, the great culture and benefits made it a really difficult decision to leave.
It’s a great place to learn and pivot your career after an advanced degree. You will work with very smart people on challenging projects. However organization structure and performance management are very opaque
For being such a corporate you would never expect that there were no specifications for a role or clear goals.Management is poor, lack of communication and there is a too conservative mindset.
Really enjoy working here! Great pay and benefits! Lots of fun corporate events and nice opportunity to travel for free when you are young. 100% remote for the most part and travel is project dependent so you don’t have to travel if you don’t want to for the most part.

Great company to work for. Work life balance is not the best but incentives and benefits make up for it. Good company culture and employee centered.  
Typical big 4 public accounting hours. People are great. Long hours during busy season but it is what it is. Great place to to start your career though since you will gain a variety of experience 
It is ok, not terrible. . It all depends on the project you are on. Great opportunity to develop and multitask. The bad thing here are campus hires who don't know anything besides consulting and later become managers and senior managers, so it shows later in their career. They simply do not understand how the world works and lack emotional intelligence. 
good experience         if you're fresh out of college, you'll learn a lot I like how they emphasized D&I effort was there, execution can have more room to growI don't have a lot to say it was a good employer it was a good opportunity to be able to work there 
The environment is friendly and questions are always welcomed and recommended.      But there seems to be less of a work/life balance, besides that everything else is fine. 
I was on a very understaffed team so we had very long hours but knew colleagues that had really manageable workloads. Overall great people at the company and great facilities and employee events. 
Was ignored for about the first year at Deloitte. Not bad hours, good pay. Then a coworker left and I realized that I was the only one on the team not working ridiculous hours.  
Great experience. Ive leaned alot at Deloitte. Not a fun place to work. Environment is pretty stressful. Management's expectation is almost not doable
Great place to work and learn the ins and out of consulting.Be ready to put in long hours and travel a lot. But the company does compensate you well. And the benefits are great.
A typical workday is at least 9 hours, and you are expected work longer. The culture is more about talking about it, than really doing it. If you can do it, and do it well, don't work at Deloitte. The hardest part of the job is to listen to two business-fluff men talking about technical stuff, while they are blissfully unaware of their incompetence.The most enjoyable part of the job is the weekend, that is if you can skip work
ProsDisgusting amount of money.ConsWhere do I begin!
Poor manager tactics, they won't teach you properly and expect things to be done overnight 15hr everyday work. They expect you to work on weekends without pay, a poor bonus. limited exposure, senior tactics
Work isn't that difficult... but if you're in a industry that you don't have interest in, then the work feels useless. great PTO. Make sure you like the people you work under - they can make your life a joy or awful.

Great benefits, well being subsidy and health insurance. You also grow pretty quickly in the audit practice up to manager. However, not so great work and life balance in the audit practice, a lot of pressure and client/project needs will always go above your own needs
"Hired to to work in one area then re-assigned to an area in which I had NO experience. NO WORK LIFE BALANCE. Too much to detail other than to say, ""don't bother"". Very cult-like culture."
Good work culture and professional environment, lots of opportunities to try something new. The culture is diverse with ppl from many different cultures and countries. 
My time at the firm was great, This is many years ago, and I have heard the firm is not the same anymore, but I have fond memories there. This was before the culture of working from home was popular, so everyone was in the office every day. Not sure I could do that today! We had catered lunches and I made some great friends there. It was a great time and I regret leaving when I did in hindsight, I was there less than 2 years. Good culture and management on my end. My only complaint is that like many organizations, I reported to an admin manager rather than the person I was with everyday. I never understood why this was set up this way. It was almost like having to sit at the kids table instead of the grown ups. I never saw my admin manager (thank goodness). 
Prosgreat firm (at the time)Consdidnt like my admin manager or that practice
Great place to begin your career and gain valuable experience. High stress environment with heavy workloads and complex work. Good  base pay, but no overtime so extremely underpaid during busy seasons.
Learned a lot working here with great benefits. Management was unimpressive. Good start to a new career if you can handle the hours. Work I was assigned too niche

"I try to stay grateful for all that I have, especially when it comes to employment, so I cannot believe how terrible my experience was and how much I regret having worked at Deloitte. I still have recurring nightmares of this experience.I worked there for over three years mostly because my work schedule did not allow me the time to look for another job. I hit bottom when a ""good day"" meant that I was outside of the office 8+ hours in a day - this went on for a full year and I did not have many good days. Ultimately there was no benefit/reward for working those hours and it cost me my physical and mental health.If you fit a certain mold then you'll do great. You'll have a few long nights here and there, but you won't have to worry about getting too overwhelmed because the people who are just like you are already looking out for you. If you're diverse in any way, good luck. You will be put under a microscope and anything you do wrong will be pointed out. It does not take long at all to see what the mold is at this company."
Prosfor some people it's not too badConsregular physical and mental exhaustion
I have been let go twice not because of performance Deloitte to actually be brought back so be careful when you think long term with this company.  They can tell you one day your a rock star and two days later let you go.
Great place to build a career and add to your resume. The company has a good mentorship program in place. However there are long hours and projects are often understaffed. You will learn and grow a lot. 
Good - Pay and bonus is subpar with market standardsBad - Long work hours, very vague tasks. A lot of politics. It's not about doing the work, but rather about creating the illusion and narrative that you are doing a lot of work. It's quite toxic.
ProsPay and bonus is subpar with market standardsConsLong work hours, very vague tasks.
Low pay, overworked,  no respect, micromanagement and our department lost many good people from poor management. You don't mean. anything unless your are management or higher. 
Fun and dynamic workplace with flexible hours and locations.Not very challenging as almost everyone follows the same growth parcours, whether you try your best or not.
Excellent company.  There are so many great things it is impossible to tell.  There are books written about this company which are wonderful resources.  It is a many times harder to get into Deloitte than Harvard.
This is a great fit for a recent college graduate.  The company invests in your training and professional development and creates a clear career path.  However, you are expected to put in 50 hours a week - 40 hours to fulfill your contract responsibilities and another 5 - 10 to contribute to the growth of Deloitte.  As a seasoned health care professional with 25+years of experience, the corporate culture was not a good fit.  I was interested in developing my professional skills but not necessarily in becoming a managing director and engaging in business development.  The specialist track is not as valued at Deloitte as ambition for becoming a managing director or partner. 
Great place to work. I really like what I do, the people are supportive and helpful, our team is remote and schedule is manageable. The projects are interesting. Compensation is good. No complaints. 
ProsRemote work, flexible schedule, interesting work, opportunities for promotion, good salaryConsClient management can be confusing
Good culture with leadership and vision best for learning new technology and management principles.Global organization with reputed professional attribute
It's a hit or miss when it comes to work life balance as a result of the Consulting area being project-focused. You will come across different work life balance than your peers, which is a bit unpredictable.
"They offer a ""bonus"" but its a loan. They won't pay you enough to be able to pay back the loan unless you sell your soul for 2 years. They won't reimburse you for mileage or gas but expect you to travel 2+ hours one way to get the access cards you need and turn around and say the ""bonus"" should have been used for reimbursement. How is it reimbursement if you have to pay it back? So you end up paying twice.  This company is Big Brother and everything you do has to benefit Deloitte and not the employee.  "
ProsWork from homeConsLow pay, no actual training, no reimbursements
It's true that busy seasons have long hours and can drain people bad during those months. But outside of busy seasons is not bad, especially summer time. Pay is fair for public accounting, but of course not as much as industry pays. I would say it has a better company culture and management than some other big fours from my experience compared to some of my friends. Would recommend for someone looking for a big four job.
It is a good first job to get you to where you want to go.  If you find a good mentor, it will take you far and help you succeed. Also, a great place to learn about technical research.  you will learn how to find the answers you are looking for. 
Everyone on the team will strongly encourage you to put your well being first, whether it be using the most you can of your PTO or taking breaks while working at the desk
Pros: Colleagues are hardworking and collaborative in helping the team be successful.Deloitte offers amazingly great benefits. Cons: Overwhelming onboarding process Promotion and substantial increase in pay pathway not entirely clear.  
GPS, and more specifically, on the federal side, Deloitte is a pretty solid place to work. Salary is a bit low if you're in the Analyst to Senior Consultant range, but Deloitte has been doing a lot to raise our salaries to help retain talent. WLB is amazing on most federal projects. My manager was a gem who was great at communicating, and it was very clear what I needed to do to receive positive feedback. Required firm initiatives are a huge pain though, which is a big gripe. GPS Deloitte also requires you to disclose all of your investments, and restricts certain types of investments like cryptocurrency. This was a big downside for me.
No work-life balance. Senior Managers and Partners are awful and provide no sense of purpose to the work - in international tax specifically. One person in & one person out is the motto - unfortunately, they currently can't hire and are losing people left and right due to the hours and lack of competitive compensation. Got yelled at for taking PTO during my engagement vacay. Also CPA is pointless for the job
ProsWork from WhereverConsManagement, ay
There is a lot to learn, and if you do, you can make some money.  It is very much a rat race here, but top producers are compensated well.  Work here if you do not have a lot of outside commitments. 
Deloitte is a very good firm believer I work for. The compensation, benefits, work/life balance are all good.  Depending on which group your in, upper leadership may not give you a fair performance review or bonus.  It’s also extremely difficult to get promoted in mid management.

It was an entry-level employment opportunity.  I was made to feel part of the team.  Corrections were constructive.  Pay was competitive and fair for entry level.  
Leadership is okay. Pay and benefits are great. Working culture isn’t the best. NPeople are always competing instead of supporting each other. Everyone is stepping on the next person to get promoted

With consulting you know what you're getting yourself into, long hours and a lot of travel. I enjoyed most of my time here and have made friends that ill have forever.
Deloitte Consulting is a great place to start out your career IF you are 1) self-motivated 2) Comfortable with putting yourself out there. A lot of what determine's one's success in consulting is not just your performance but who you know in your network. Most of the time, it is about working smarter and not harder. Perceptions are held to a high standard and outweigh actual performance. 
ProsGreat PTO (23 days to start and you accrue more as you get promoted), great people, lots of health/well-being/work from home subsidiesConslarge range in pay bands and lack of transparency with salary decisions
 If you want a decent job, this place is a very decent place to work, extremely decent pay and very decent colleagues, the CEO is decent and the workload is decent

I enjoy my job times with the project. Working loads balance are normal, Monday to Friday working schedule, sometimes Sunday having on call rotation basis.

Deloitte is a great firm, great benefits (including $1000 annual well-being subsidy, Deloitte University trainings, in-person social events —think baseball games and happy hours— if you’re staffed to a local project, etc.) but it is not for everyone! It’s a fast paced environment, which can be very stressful at times, and management has rebranded “work-life balance” as “work-life fit,” which says a lot about the expectations around productivity and hours worked (the benchmark for utilization is 45hrs/week). Granted, not every position is like this all the time, but definitely think twice if you’re more of a “work to live” kind of person.  
Great brand nameRespected firmOpportunity for growthLarge clients Fair PayHours can get long during busy seasonMeritocracy Good technologyNetworking within firm
Like any other job the people you work with will make a big difference. My time at the company was enjoyable and the team I was assigned to never made me feel unwelcome.
Smart people, interesting work. Respectful and collaborative culture. Excellent work life balance. Emphasis on continued training. Innovative environment.
ProsWork life balance. Smart peopleConsCompensation is the only are for improvement
Great compensation. The USDC office has built a great culture and prioritizes work-life balance. You have endless resources for professional development. If you’re client-facing, your manager and/or team lead will vary by project. Some are great leaders while others are ineffective. Medical benefits at this level are average.
Deloitte is a nice place to start and build a career. There are ample opportunities to learn. Employees are treated respectfully and leadership stresses on work life balance.   
ProsContinuous learning and work life balanceConsSlow career progress
I work in China mainland office, and its duty basically is to serve HK office. We work almost the same hours, but HK pay much more than it in mainland.so i dun suggest big 4 dreamer inaugurated in mainland offices.ppl here, esp mgt, are mostly insane because yr and yr long working hours and disrespect from clients 
Prossocial insurance ok. basic package ok. co-workers education okConsot divers from real ot hours too much, i should receive at least 1.5x of now
Had no real sense of purpose in my internship and came away without really learning anything. Did not feel like my hard work into projects and work was not appreciated and very hard to switch businesses within Deloitte.
Prosfree lunches, nice bonus, free timeConsnot purposeful
You drown or swim type of learning experience. I came in as an experienced hire, so content wise was very strong and able to provide to my colleagues and clients. My personal growth accelerated in the 3 years I've been there. Will not be where I am without the Deloitte experience and name on my resume. I loved the people I worked with, many of them became good friends. If you are ambitious, up for the challenge and eager to grow and not afraid of a fast pace environment, this is the place for you. 
ProsTalented colleagues, learn from everyone, young and fun cultureConswork life balance takes a toll
Lot of overtime and unrecognised for part of the management. You will only be promoted to upper positions if you kiss assess.  
I have come across the most hard working and knowledgable bunch of individuals and learned a great deal working side by side them. Folks are really smart and can articulate complex situations in a simple easy to understand language. It is a great place to work if you want to progress your career as a consultant. However, not the right place to advance product management career. I am a Sr. Product Manager with more than seven years of experience. I was lucky to get great opportunities to express my passion for product management however from long term career perspective this is not the right place. 
ProsLots of team/ fun events, happy hoursConsWork life balance gets disturbed depending upon the nature of work
Assigned to job, work with new ppl all the time ,learning all the time. Long hours , but like a graduate school in terms of learning the ropes at large companies
ProsPd overtimeConsAlways working
Solid company. Amazing, talented people. DEI. Resourceful. Great learning experiences. Dynamic work environment. Many growth opportunities are available in verticals of interest.
Lots of long term employee, stable company, pays well, but depending on the team you are put in you can either have a fantastic manager or an awful manager. Tired of corporate america going to work for myself!
Not a bad place to start a career (or jump start one) but I didn’t feel very fulfilled in my projects and not always a lot of support. This is team dependent but the lack of consistency is definitely something to keep in mind if you’re thinking of applying to Deloitte.
I would give an over all rating for this company in the following:Good benefit , pay is  ok but stressful environment. Career advancement available. 
Fast paced environment, beautiful offices, great colleagues and possibility to evolve, high turnover but young and talented team. Flexibility and you can get a car
ProsBenefits, carConsHigh pressure
Pros*Good pay, benefits and hours for gov. consulting*Most respected, large gov. consulting practice*Lower level coworkers are often cool*Incredible breadth of offeringsCons*Consultants are expected to have 'extra-curricular' work beyond client work, where no one is focused or responsive because it's not their main job. Often feels like your client work isn't as important as winning the favor of various company managers who know nothing of your main job (the client work)*Terrible onboarding experience if you're not staffed to a project - you have to cold email/call en masse instead of talent reps helping you*Senior management pretends to be engaged and in control on client accounts but isn't, leaving a vacuum of decisive action*Internal company documentation and communication of policies and resources is awful, causes lots of confusion and frustration; you're expected to network your way past the company's dysfunctional processes*Too many company resources spent on borderline pointless lectures and meetings instead of decisive action and quality tools/documentation
There ARE some good people here, but by and large the firm is dominated by egotistical drama queens who think they can only advance by throwing you under the bus when your back is turned.
ProsGood salary and benefitsConspeople who think they know everything
Great benefits they truly do care about their employees! Need to do better with work / life fit balance. Need to offer more for the working moms and instead of just preaching it actually practice it!
Wonder full job love going there everyday and putting in work loving the staff is great love the respect and the environment great pay sec in the back
a lot of resources at disposal for skilling up, the company encourages conferences attendance. a lot of teammates invites for exchanges over a meal or a cup, liked the meet and mingle activities
It all depends on which path you take, either Project Delivery, Specialist, or Consulting.  Each has its own perks and drawbacks.  In Project Delivery, you need to have 90% utilization and hoildays count against that percentage which really makes it hard for you to use the generous amount of PTO they offer.
Excelente equipo y excelente sueldo. Buen ambiente laboral 
Good place to work career growth and opportunities a lot of things to learn hikes variable pay compensation benefits are good management is good and understanding
ProsPay hikes compensation benefitsConsWork life balance
Deloitte is a strong global company that does great work and cares about its people.Prior to Deloitte I had never stayed at one company for more than about 5 years.It’s been 10 years at Deloitte and I will likely stay there here until  I retire.
A lot of demands on your time make the work worth while for the benefit of the company. You put in a lot of time but are given back rewards by the amount of donated time to good causes.
Poor management and terrible corporate culture. Laziness is rewarded and no one wants to hear suggestions for ways to improve. They are stuck in the past and many good people are leaving as a result.

I learned a lot in DeloitteGood work experienceManagers and team leads are very cooperativeNo stress, no hard timelinesWork culture is very good in Deloitte
It is a place to start career,For most Accounting Students that wants to grow their career in Accounting, Auditing, Financial Advisory and Tax. We do multi tasking more at January to June because it's the peak period to audit most companies account. We still have our leave to relax during slack period . Deloitte gives you six weeks of paid leave to read for your professional exam and you still have like two weeks of your normal leave to relax and travel. Deloitte covers your exams fees and tuition fees to sit for the professional exams.It is a lovely place to be. Great team work amongst the employees.  
They change so many hands from the recruiting process to onboarding. I encountered 6 people before training and no one could be reached for questions about who was my point of contact after training. Very odd process. I experienced a lot of talking an no action. 
ProsWell being benefitsConsCommunication, Talent Development
I had a horrible experience working for Deloitte. The managers are very toxic and won't allow you to be successful. Deloitte only cares about how much money you can bring to the firm. So if you try to complain about the manager to partner, most of the time they will not take any actions.  
Contractors have to work huge work load and can still be unappreciated. Full time employees do get more benefits but are sometimes treated unfairly. A lot of people leave because of the enormous workload. 
ProsThe pay.ConsHuge work load.
Worked on some really good IT projects.  However, the work can be highly stressful at times which can affect your work life balance.  Management was ok.  Some projects had unrealistic deadlines.   Great Benefits.
ProsFree beverages, Great Benefits, Nice UniversityConsWork can become stressful
At Deloitte, the people make the work enjoyable.  The firm strives to provide its workforce positive career experiences, even allowing employees to grow into new career roles and responsibilities.  The work is challenging, but fulfilling. Travel can be demanding; however, the firm is transparent about this upfront in the recruitment process. I liken a career at Deloitte to being a professional athlete: put in the sweat equity, effort, discipline, and teamwork and you’ll earn your spot in the starting lineup.  Deloitte honors its commitment to DEI and wellness. It’s a company that cares about its people, clients, and professional practices. 
ProsDaily opportunities to make a positive impactConsWork can sometimes be very demanding
Lots of opportunities if you're willing to put in 50+ hours per week. Overtime is unpaid and expected, and with salaries that are well below market rate it's extremely exploitive.
ProsJob Stability, Benefits are amazingConsLow pay, Long hours, chaotic projects due to poor management
Enter the workplace here - it will set you up for success later in your career. Its a great name to have on your resume, but the audit side is not the most fun.
Worked here for four years--great experience, good people (for the most part), great culture, great benefits. Common to work 80 - 100 hours per week during Q1 (better work/life balance for the remainder of the year), but the experience is priceless. Similar to other Big 4, Deloitte is a critical stepping stone to be successful in accounting/finance. 
I had good exposure on the key areas of my work basically. No room for training so your personal development is in your hands. Poor leadership though but focus on the work. Maybe because it was Nigeria though, the culture was quite toxic and allowed managers to retaliate when employees speak up. I would recomed deloitte for anyone who wishes to be exposed to best models and frameworks of doing work. Its a good exposure.
ProsGreat place to learn on the jobConspoor leadership
Great place to learn if you don't mind being slightly underpaid and work long hours during busy season. The most enjoyable part about this job is the people you get to work with. 
Great company to begin your career. Looks good on a resume. Very demanding work load.Work life balance is not for the faint of heart. You will work more than you see your family. Great pay but you will work for it.Lots of office politics you will have to turn a blind eye toYou can work hard and put much time and effort into moving up and quickly get passed over for someone with less experience and time with the company. 
Good company to work. Working with smart people and learning new things everyday. They care employees well and their benefits are great. Many happy hours and gathering event. 
This is a great place to start your career. You will learn a lot. Training is good. The companies with which you will work are amazing.  At least where I worked, management was unprofessional, and there was a high school vibe. 
The company expects you to work 45 hours a week minimum, for low pay and no overtime. They love to flaunt how they  promote well being, yet I don’t understand how that can be attainable when we’re overworked and underpaid. I don’t have time to utilize the well being resources they offer. The overall feeling is that everyone is too busy all the time, making it feel chaotic, rushed, and sloppy. 
-Endless growth and learning opportunities-High performers are rewarded appropriately (competitive culture typical of consulting)-Great compensation package
Good place for fresh graduate as their first job. Good name on resume for future opportunities. Growth path is clear. Sometimes it depends on luck to have a good team lead.
Deloitte is a great company. They offer many tools to help you succeed. The salary and benefits, including PTO are a definite PLUS!! There are many career paths within the Organization if you want to learn another LOB.
Work life balance is sometimes possible, it depends on the project you're staffed on. You rarely get aligned to the projects that best match your skills unless you network with the right people. Salary in advisory could be better. The greater company culture may be different then the culture you experience on projects.

Projects that are lengthy, but allow you to learn certain industries. Very long hours most of the time and bad WLB. Good brand for building your rseume.
One of the best companies for entry-level professionals. Decently flexible work schedules, helpful superiors, engaging tasks and overall comfortable environment.
I spent 8 weeks at Deloitte as a Vacationer. Whilst my team was fairly quiet work-wise, I enjoyed doing the work I could help out with. People were great and I felt really valued and supported.
I really enjoy working for Deloitte. Being able to work remotely gives me more time to spend with my family. The supervisors seem to really care, and go out of their way to help you.
I always felt supported at Deloitte. They are always looking for ways to help you advance. It is really great to have so much paid time off and the collective disconnect around the holidays.
Deloitte is an awesome place to work. There are really smart people who know what they are doing. This is an excellent opportunity for someone straight out of college to gain expertise and the skill set to thrive in the workforce.
Managers feel a little all over the place, everyone runs things differently. Co workers make or break your time at this job. Benefits are great but raise isnt in our position . 
"Flexible with changes that need to be made to support its employees. I learned that you truly have to know someone in power in order to move into what you desire to do. The workplace culture ""claims"" to support work/life balance but to be promotable, it is not so. The people at Deloitte overall are a great group. Management needs review and should be more open to listening to the subordinates when rating the performance of leadership."
Its okay, enjoyed my internship; however, I decided public accounting at a large firm may not be the best fit for me. It is a great place to learn and grow as a young public accountant.
Very high pace, tough work life balance but it was a great learning experience. Learned about working as a team, managing people, expectations and deadlines. The firm was also very good at training their people and getting them ready to perform their jobs. 
Worked on the PD model at Deloitte. Benefits are less than those on the traditional track. Pay is worse.The reason is supposedly because you have more work life balance, but I found myself doing just as much as everyone else. Not supported by management at all and don’t care to ever go back.
ProsThe name
Enjoyed my audit internship; however, I decided public accounting at a large firm may not be the best fit for me.  It is a great place to learn and grow as a young public accountant. 
good and respectful working environment, flexible hours and option to work remotely good and respectful working environment ,very interesting job when you always learn something new 
Enjoy my time at Deloitte and all of the things I have learned and all of the people I have worked with. It is a very inclusive company and a lot of great benefits. The pay scale could be higher but the benefits are high. There are busy times that are stressful and then not so busy times with great work life balance. 
ProsBenefits and experiencesConsLower pay scale comparatively and sometimes stressful
Great entry level opportunities and other opportunities for advancement if you want to stay with industry/company. Ability to work independently, but work can be stressful at times. 
Have an opportunity to learn a lot of things There is really no work life balance But overall ,if you have good team members  and managers , it will help a lot 
ProsOpportunities for growthConsLong work hours
Deloitte is a fun place to work especially on the GPS practice. Work life balance is great with a lot of interesting work. Smart people and some great benefits as well.
Lots of opportunity to learn and grow professionally while making great pay. Lots of contracts to make lateral moves to and upward mobility is easy enough. Some management teams are out of touch with employee needs and daily work/life balances, which can make for awkward conversations to realign your purposes, but nothing insurmountable with enough determination.
ProsPay, benefits, events/partiesConsNo sick leave (even for emergencies)
Had no real sense of purpose in my internship and came away without really learning anything. Did not feel like my hard work into projects and work was not appreciated and very hard to switch businesses within Deloitte.

ProsFlexibility, 100% remote work, good recognition from project leadConsLow pay at Delivery Centers, lots of politics within team.
Good company to start and grow yourself in IT consulting. Provide good perks and benefits. Technology Stacks changes project by the project it gives you comprehensive knowledge about different technologies but the same way you don't become expert in any new technology.
ProsGood Perks and BenefitsConsLong hours Lots of meetings
The couple of years I've been there I've enjoyed the different project I was tasked too. It helped me learn new things while working with different styles of management. PTO is generous and the work I had was flexible. 
Typical Client Engagements.Great Training Program.Great Team to work with.Great Managers and Partners.Great Seniors.Great Environment.Great Flexibility.
Work-life balance is good considering the compensation.Plenty of partners running their own shops, so quality of work really depends upon which partner you end up working for. Recently, the firm restructured itself to combine S&O with Technology. Since then the volume of core management consulting work has seen a reduction. Partner politics has also gone off the roof ever since the labor crunch.That said, if you're on the Technology side it's a good opportunity to stick around and grow in the firm. Exactly opposite advice for anyone on the management consulting side - run for your career and never look back.
ProsGreat work life balance compared to the MBBs of the world, Significantly lesser artificial stress as well - so way better for your mental health, Good learning platform for early exposure to management consulting, Great growth opportunities for Technology folksConsSome partners are extremely toxic - find them early and run away from them, Future outlook for management consulting is bleak, Brand value has been eroding over time
Long hours. Many skills development opportunities. High performing culture. Managemnt cares about staff for the most part. Hardest part of the job is Managing high expectations. Enjoyble part of the job is the direct impact the work has on licves.
ProsSmart people.ConsTerrible work life balance
Very stressful.Very less benefits and very less salary It's hard to get promotion within Deloitte.Too much of competition to move to next level in Deloitte
A good place for accounting major to start career but the leadership in NYC office at least in BTS Group does not really care about the staff and the comp is too low in the market 
Deloitte is great place to start off your career and build a strong diverse skill set. You have opportunities to build on soft and hard skills and learn many of the basics of how to tell a story and communicate to clients. employees have many opportunities to network and meet other professionals in their preferred field.  Work is demanding and high quality of work products is a necessity, but well-being is still valued and many different avenues of support are offered.
ProsGreat work culture, Learning opportunities, Varied day to day work, Competitive compensation, Lots of PTO and wellbeing timeConsPoor retirement matching, Work can vary greatly depending on clients and managers
I was a receptionist and enjoyed work for the most part, not much diversity at all which was problematic. Management was pretty good, benefits were wonderful. 
I started working for Deloitte as a contractor. Things started off great at first. My supervisor was easy to get along with as well as the team lead. It turns out my boss was just trying to make himself look good. When I showed a mastery of the basic skills, he put me up for a promotion to a different team that I did not want, nor that would fit around my personal life. When my health started to suffer, I asked to be transferred back. He told me it would look bad if I were to do so. I had to bring up my poor health as a reason, which I should not have had to in the first place.I ended up then being transferred as a relief employee when other teams' workloads were too much. Towards the end, I got placed with a super awesome team, but only had them for a month. In the end, I worked two extra days and found out I had been laid off. The days were compensated, but again, lack of communication was a problem.The first set of managers were extremely hard to deal with. They were very unorganized and would notify you of changes last minute and expect you to be okay with them. It was hard to plan anything. The 2nd team lead I had was very unprofessional and kept telling me to work past the time I got off. This team lead also loved to throw extra work at me and expect me to get it done same day. They wrote nasty emails if you didn't get it done or tried to explain to them you were finishing up work from the previous day. If you learn new skills, they will not  compensate you for it. If you help the team out, the supervisor and team lead basically disappear and expect you to take on - more...
"ProsLearn different skills and programs while on a projectConsWant great work for cheap, don't care if you get paid on time, will give you a ""promotion, "" and double your workload without proper compensation, unprofessional work environment, lack of communication is a frequent problem, expect you to change your personal life schedule around them at the drop of a hat."
Was good pay and benefits.  World class firm, but US Employees are not what they are after, so was constantly thinking we were going to get dumped for cheap overseas workers.
ProsGood pay.
Great work and pay  Deloitte is the industry standard for work in the intelligence community and I am extremely proud to work for them. They offer great work life balance and even health stipends. We get performance bonuses and I think I am well compensated for my work at Deloitte.
ProsGreat work and payConsNone
Great place to learn a ton in a short period. In consulting, projects can be very  hit or miss. People are great, and culture and morale are surprisingly good for such a massive corporation. 
Really loved the company so much, great management team, great coworkers, great clients, lot of freedom and autonomy, great pay and benefits, just a great place to work
This can be a difficult culture to assimilate into when you join with years of experience. Feels like an inordinate focus on individual employee brand and network building over true team work and shared goals.
 I feel that this place could use a little more structure and too many micro managing lost managers without a clue in the world. Its just a place to call work and nothing more and I never want to work here again. When people want you to just get the job done and not worried about getting your timesheet processed there is a issue and principle facts to the matter. Its 2021 who still does timesheet on emails and not time system.   there is no adknowledgement of the employee given its basically slaveship.
ProsPaycheck, work hours, work is easyConsMicro manage, arogant leaders that worry about numbers only and blind as a bat. No structure.
"High profile cases. Interesting work. Lots of bureaucracy. Lots of ""busywork"" and unnecessary job requirements that take up a lot of time and need to be conducted after reaching the weekly 40 billable hours...."
This can be a difficult culture to assimilate into when you join with years of experience. Feels like an inordinate focus on individual employee brand and network building over true team work and shared goals.

"The culture at Deloitte is based on ""making the paper"" the rest of the talk is just dressing to promotes its image.  When the rubber hits the road no matter how altruistic, collaborative, ethical and productive you are, unless you are generating revenue you are cost to be assessed.There is a caste system.  Partners Principals and Managing Directors in the client-facing side. Commerical (Legacy) is held in higher regard than Public Sector.  Technical/client-facing is rated separately than office back-up.  There current orientation is to automate or move activities to India."
"ProsSome really interesting work and talented peopleConsUpper management does not invest unless you are ""flavor of the month"", and they do play favorites"
Deloitte is recognized as one the big four firms with a great reputation, however the company falls short of wanting to retain their talent. There are more cons than pros. You are expected to travel staying in hotels more than your home which is taxing on anyone who has a family making you a part -time parent and spouse at best. When you raise your concerns to your leadership team they pretend to care and make you feel like you should be grateful to be working for Deloitte as oppose to working with you. You will have constant travel along with tedious unrelated tasks to your job and no admin time to get assigned tasks completed. There are no bonuses offered to field consultants only managers which is disappointing considering all of the hours you put in for your client, yet the company sends out Regular updates on how they’re performing well in sales year over year growing their business. Seeing that Deloitte is doing so well and the team is not reaping any of those benefits is disappointing. You will get a salary of 50K with all the unreasonable demands that will have you question if you want to keep your job or your family this is a terrible feeling. At the salary being offered you can find that anywhere these days without any travel. Considering the job market now I would hope Deloitte starts listening to their employees to make positive changes otherwise they will be know as revolving door of talent who burnout every 6 months and looking for replacements constantly. 
ProsPer diem for meals when traveling, rental cars for field work, well-subsidy benefit, and reputable brand for resumeConsSalary, work-life balance, no bonus structure, no holiday incentive, extensive travel, unreasonable demands, poor leadership creating toxic culture
Deloitte is an awesome place to work especially right after undergraduate. You work with bright people who are driven. The camaraderie is excellent. The pay lags behind most industries. After 2 years I left for 2.5X comp elsewhere working for half of the hours.
ProsCoworkersConsPay, Work Life Balance
Learn a lot in short amount of time. Supportive and smart colleagues and global experiences. Can be slow moving and extremely beaucratic which I don’t love 
ProsComp benefits work remote travelConsLost in shuffle. Sociopaths
Your experience in audit is extremely client dependent. I've had horrible clients where you are working 15 hours a day and others where we barely had to work 8. Management is a bit frustrating as they refuse to hire an adequate number of staff. This leads to burnout for others which leads to turnover and even more staff shortages.Work/life balance does not exist during busy season and if you are truly unlucky, HR will book you onto multiple clients. I was once on a client where we did not hit the 55 hour minimum for busy season. Because I was only charging 45 hours a week, HR assigned 10 hours a week to a completely unrelated client. TL;DR - Typical B4 experience - learn a lot and get burned out
Great experience and top level clients, although projects can be less than exciting and cutting edge. Definitely a door opening experience for future employment if you decide to move on from big D.
ProsSalary, stability, work from home forever, lots of opportunities across different industries and roles on client projectsConsExperience really depends on which project teams you’re placed on
Horrible work environment and culture. No teamwork, everyone is out for themselves. Your leads scream and yell at you on a daily basis.  No work/life balance. You will feel beaten down everyday.
ProsMoney and benefitsConsEnvironment and culture
Deloitte is a company where you have to start your career. You will be under the guidance of many top notch talents and a place where things are challenging. The connections at deloitte will help in your life.
ProsPtoConsStressful, tight dealines, more work
Hours are very demanding; every season is busy season. PTO plan ok, but hard to fully check out. Technology not the best - had issues applying to join, during hiring process and navigating a complex web of internal sites and databases. Tools I needed to do my job often crash, take forever to access and do not always integrate with clients or home office environments. Email overkill with calls about calls, running to meetings about other meetings. Processes often mundane, repetitive, and overlapping. Culture is clique, not very inclusive and lacking in diversity.Firmwide communication style is fairly direct, forthcoming. People on an individual level are very bright, friendly - hard working and best in class.Performance management, measurement and feedback are very low resolution. Management at times disconnected; not very personable, difficult to build rapport and gain trust with.Leaders are dry, by the book, close to the vest types, singing company songs. Organization feels oversized, change is slow and heavy isolation to your business line/practice area. Voice feels unheard, skills undervalued.  Recruited on creativity and innovation, hired by a herd culture.

It's contract work so you may end up moving between projects/clients frequently which may be good or bad.  I do software development so I'm not sure about the accounting/business areas but am sure it's similar.

"The Study.com system is full of ""how-to"" information in order for you to be successful with the company. However, you have to want it and avail yourself of the helpful tools that, once you learn how to use them quickly, will lead to getting paid. You will not get rich quick with Study.com. You need to follow the steps and be assiduous in your work. You will need to have thick skin and be able to take constructive feedback. The company has a system whereby everyone contributes to a project (a lesson or a video, etc.). Lastly, working for Study.com will help you rethink how you deliver information effectively.Pros"
The managers are very supportive and you have the opportunity to apply what you've learned to the industry product. The feedback from managers is very responsive. 
Work hard, be open and willing to help your team succeed. Everyone is willing to work hard. We are part of the Government service line, so it is important for everyone in that state and beyond to get a sense of well-being when Deloitte is hired. 
Although my time as a contractor for Deloitte was productive, there have been some toxic colleagues I've encountered. I have been gossiped behind my back, got called ignorant upfront, got judged for not sharing more in casual conversations, and was belittled by the Program Manager who worked during my time and was recommended that I should engage with other colleagues too. 
ProsBreakfast FridaysConsSome colleagues are toxic
Every day is a winding road here. No sleep, no peace. The money is decent sure but you won't have time to spend it. You will learn a lot and that's the great thing. You will have fun, but the suffering is inevitable.
Prosfree lunch, nice office, feel importantConsnight terrors, anxiety
Like all consulting the contracts end. Never stop looking for new opportunities and educational opportunities. The best people to connect with for opportunities are other consultants. Partners and Directors can be helpful in some cases. 
Very smart people and continuous learning. Emphasis on work life balance but does not always happen. Great benefits, PTO and culture. Do not want to leave. 
It's a great place to get experience under your belt if you a college hire or an experienced hire and want to move to different technological area.  It does require hard work and they expect a lot from you but there is lots of opportunity to move up if you are willing to take on leadership roles.  
ProsGenerous PTO policy, great work life balanceCons401k could be better
Deloitte is a place where you can learn and grow at the same time. yes at times the work can take a toll but believe me it makes an excellent company for your CV
It's a good first job, they train you well, the hours are long during busy season of course but that is expected. You will learn a lot but will risk burnout same as any firm though. 
Deloitte is filled with people in their management who create a toxic working environment: long unpaid hours, unreasonable demands on your personal life (working for free on weekends, including Saturdays & Sundays), coupled with a lot of office politics and hierarchical bureaucracy. Would not recommend working here, unless you want to use it as a stepping stone and move onto a career which is more rewarding where you can showcase your true strengths and thrive in a respectful & challenging working environment. 
ProsIndustry exposureConsUnderpaid, very long hours (weekends, incl sundays for no pay), office politics
Your experience will depend a lot depending on what team, manager, and location you have. Pay is sub-par compared to industry for my field, whilst the work-life balance isn't great (don't expect a 9 to 5). Once you get to SM level, the promotion process is very obscure, and it's not clear how to get promoted. The work isn't that interesting, and you'll often find yourself doing the same things - usually the budget doesn't allow for things to be done differently, just to churn things out.Good points is that they are flexible in terms of where you work (i.e. you can work from home). Though this has downsides as well, since you don't feel part of the team.
Amazing people, opportunities and job advancement. Apply ASAP and if you get an interview be extremely grateful. Great establishment. Love Deloitte with all my heart

The Company gives $500 for you to spend to buy peloton, Xbox, yoga mats, etc. Inventory count lunch is $30-60! The hardest part of the job is moving from one job to another and lack of training.

Worked for Delloitte for 4 months, hired though external contractor In as Case Manager in Maryland. Work experience was horrible, poor upper management with no knowledge of program, mandatory over time of 15+ hours each week, had to work 15 hours a day once a week because of deadline. Supervisors has no empathy,  no advancement
ProsnoneConslong hours, poor management, low pay, suffocating work environment
Worked in audit for 2 years. There is no work life balance, you essentially sign your freedom away for the prestige of working at a B4. It's just the nature of being in audit in public accounting. People and culture are amazing, met some of my best friends at the company.
ProsCorporate Card, Cool PeopleConsLong Hours
World class client base; intelligent and well meaning colleagues; even if you spend a couple of years here, the brand resonates on your resume. Work life balance can be an issue particularly with more demanding clients. 
Deloitte is intense. Onboarding is horrendous, both to the firm and each project. Good thing is teams form around projects, so you can choose what you want to work on and interview for it. Success is largely dependent on networking skills and the reputation you build for yourself. Learning opportunities abound, and the culture is supportive of well being and work life balance only if it doesn’t interfere with client work. If the client aka manager-with-no-boundaries wants something predawn or on the weekend, the expectation is that you hop to. There are truly meaningful projects to do, but they are rarely given the attention they deserve because the goal is to charge maximum fees in minimum time. Therefore, you will be pushed towards out-of-the-box solutions (Salesforce) and if you DO get a project with room to customize or explore, the timeline is nearly always insane and you will have to cut major corners to meet the arbitrary deadlines. The pay isn’t enough for anyone who wants a life, but it’s a great first job for the hazing experience. It will toughen you up. Just get out before you become a consultant drone who talks fast in acronyms and whips out meaningless PowerPoint decks that say a lot and deliver nothing.

based on what i've gathered about the big 4, deloitte seems pretty similar to the others. there's pros and cons. traditional tax group work hours are terrible but the longer you stay more flexibility you can earn.

ProsBenefitoConsLong hour
Deloitte is a great place to work in theory.. If you are under good management (staffed on a good team or well functioning project) and/or get assigned a decent coach who actually cares about their role in helping you navigate the company you will do well. From my experience there, the culture is bad, good people are overworked and mistreated because everyone up the chain of command is either trying to save their own skin or stay out of the way. As a first job in a new career, in a big company, fresh out of school, I came in very excited and it was a horrible experience that left me questioning my career change.
ProsWell recognized company nameConswork life balance, culture, growth opportunites, culture, work environment, culture

Constantly surrounded by some of the smartest people in the industry. Great opportunity to network and meet professionals with diverse backgrounds from all over the world.
ProsColleagues/NetworkingConsWork Life Balance
This is a consulting company meaning the work is all project based and 9/10 your opinion, perceptions, and experience will be based on the project(s) you're staffed on. My experience was not that good majority of my time was spent on projects outside of my skillset or on a project doing repetitive, mundane tasks (excel and powerpoint is your best friend here). Its pretty hard to move around to different projects or business line, especially if you are in the USDC vs Deloitte Core. The culture is work, work, work. Most people are overworked and on multiple projects so its hard getting inn contact with them to ask the simplest question. The other half of people pretends to be busy all the time to avoid work, even leadership. There is alot of Indians so expect a cultural shift if you're not used to working with alot of Indians. The benefits are great. You get a work phone, work laptop, company card for expenses, and a bunch of other perks of working for a Big4.

"I worked for Deloitte for over 4 years. Here is what you need to know about Deloitte:If you are looking to get experience and want various hands on opportunities in different technologies, this is a great place to start your career... But for those who have experience, You will ONLY get your title and compensation in the hiring processes. Do not look for it in raises or ""promotions"" . This is a place to get your experience and GET OUT.. Two years tops, then look for something else. Do NOT let Deloitte try and tell you you are part of the this or that, ""build your brand"" and try and lead you into staying. They will tell you how pivotal you are to the company, then when year end comes they try and give you the least amount possible.After seeing a young coworker become senior over me with only a quarter of the tenure I had, none of the certifications, and I was expected to teach her infrastructure, I had to make a decision and look else where. I understood what was going on. I did not fit into their DEI vision.In closing, get your experience, get your certifications, make Deloitte pay for them, and find another company. that is the best advise I can give you.. Dont waste your time like I did and many others did thinking you are apart of the culture or let them tell you you are valued. because take it from me, once you show them you got another higher offer somewhere else, they will toss you aside and not entertain matching it to keep you. You are replaceable here, if you keep that in mind you will have the right mind set for the company."
ProsPay for CertsConsDei
With 300k employees you would think there was room for advancement but Deloitte only talk the talk and doesn’t walk the walk. It’s still who you know. It’s a shot in the dark on your job because it depends on the manager you get.

"I was a Management Assistant at Deloitte for a year. I was paid extremely bad compared to the work load and amount of responsibility I had.

I would definitely go back working there, just not as an assistant."

ProsPay, benefits, work culture.ConsToo many bosses.
Overall, it's an okay place to work and the pay is fair. Not a good work-life balance, leading to stress and other issues. Projects are not well-planned in advance and may not even suit your skillet, but management expects you to complete the work somehow, with little-to-no guidance. If you don't do well on a project, they tend to blame/gaslight you. There are no real promotions or ways to move up. They may bump your pay or give you a small bonus, but it's harder to get an actual promotion. You are judged more on data and performance analytics than actual skill or talent, which causes many people to end up leaving despite the so-called *perks* and benefits. They collect so much information on you as an employee that it can feel like you're an experiment or lab rat, especially when they keep changing the system they use to decide if you are performing well at your job. 
ProsPayConsLack of support on projects, too much data collection, ever-changing data and performance analytics can affect your job (layoffs, promotions, bonuses)

Deloitte consulting has many different departments and if you enter at the entry level it can be difficult to steer yourself into a project you love. After 2 years I managed to network my way into a team I wanted to work with, but depending on the person this can take shorter or longer. Also I have heard many of my colleagues are returning to traveling full or part time so keep that in mind
People you work with are smart, work can be interesting, but morale has generally been low due to poor work life balance and low compensation relative to peers.

Deloitte is a great place to work as someone else has said if you already understand the way the Big 4 work. Coming from a smaller technical company more focused on a particular section it can be a horrible/jarring experience.There's a lot of prerequisites related to reporting and compliance that may be unusual to you. The work environment at least for a Developer can be very tough and unrealistic depending on your project. As a friend of mine said if you're on the right project and ok with just working on cruise control you'll be fine. If you want a sense of purpose and meaning in your work maybe not.I personally felt that I was thrown into a fire with no way to survive besides brute force. My particular project was disorganized and management felt like they were working against us with the drive to do things we couldn't possibly get done being understaffed. 
I've been at this firm for nearly seven years and have learned a tremendous amount in every role I've earned. Smart people and challenging work; this type-A, high-functioning culture is not for everyone. I'm actually really happy with my job.

Doesn't matter if you move out of client services, that mentality seeps into everything at the firm. Projects are always understaffed because we only win sales by underbidding. If you find your niche and a PPMD who has your back, you will do better. It's a very cliquey environment.

Worked for more than a year in the Financial Advisory department, but managers were not really keen to help you out. They kind of expected you to know everything and left you be to whatever they asked. In addition, they would ask you really tedious things that didn't really add value right when you were about to leave even though you sometimes barely did anything throughout the day. In any case, I did get to learn how to do valuation models better and presentations. Besides the case, I didn't really have support or a normal human relationship with my boss or other colleagues. Very strange indeed.

Always out of town.  Pompous people.  They expect to own you.  Never felt valued or appreciated.  Totally focused on clients and not employees.

As a contractor (which is a very sizable portion of those working at Deloitte), you are the fall guy/girl.

It is difficult to promote team mentality when employees are in constant competition with one another.  In the end what you see is inflated egos running rampant stepping over peers for recognition.
The most enjoyable part of the job is that I work with a team of smart and kind people who are passionate about clients and the work we do.

"Management is poor and unable to provide assistance. They do not know what goes on day-to-day and making time to speak with them is impossible. Work life balance is non-existent for some individuals. Management will give you new PPMDs with no warning or care if you are able to maintain a balance. They only say ""you're team with help"". Pay is okay for out-of-college job, however, new hires will make more than you. Worked 2+ years and new hires were making $1,500-6000 more than me with less job experience and new college hires. If you want a job for 1-2 years and have some decent pay, this would be good. No direction or help from leadership to get you to where you want to go. Its all on you, which is fine, but management could care less about you and what you do next. Only care about their performance reviews and critics staff even though if management was around more and cared about the issues that every ESC brings up - they'd have a better work environment and people would talk negatively about this position.

Culture in USDC is poor, no flexibility in work. No work life balance. You can advance in your career if you are close to manager not based on technical competency. I had been working other consulting projects which had flexibility, good culture and time. But I don’t recommend to join in USDC especially Mechanisburg. 
Great company to work for. Learn a lot by working on different projects. Coworkers are highly driven and talented. There is a lot of work but you get to learn very fast. 
Many opportunities for personal growth and development; interesting people and good assignments; many opportunities for travel and training. Overall a great place to start. 
No work life balance and compensation is not good enough.Stress is very high and turn over ratio is very high.But you work with a lot of nice and smart people.
Deloitte is your typical Big 4 tax consulting firm. The culture of the LA office is a bit fraternity/ sorority like. Lots of social events and drinking in conjunction with A LOT of work. Working the social network at the firm is equally as important as the work. 
ProsStrong name on a resume, opportunity to work on impressive clients, ability to steer your careerConsInsane hours, intense social culture
Deloitte is a great place to start your career. You'll get out how much you put into the job. Sometimes, you have to network your way into a project but overall a good environment. Competitive because everyone you are working with is super smart. 
Deloitte was a great place to hone consulting skills.  Employees were expected to work very hard - long days on assignment and frequent weekend work, but the learning opportunities were good and compensation was excellent.
Excellent benefits; but no time to go to the doctor. Too many hours, not paid nearly as much. Absolutely no work life balance, but most people would see it as a career advancement opportunity. 
ProsWfh, Benefits, Career. AdvancmentConsStressful, Much Anxiety, Too many Hours
lots of project and good customers , wor life balance is as per the team , growth is dependent on the individual and there is no formal process for identifying talent
5 star training center with access to many guest perks, including free Starbucks!   Employees are provided flexibility for personal time whenever needed.
ProsFree Breakfast and lunch
In my role I assisted seven amazing partners with reaching their goals for the firm. Deloitte will award you for your hard work, that’s one of the things I enjoyed about working there. My opinions and suggestions mattered and were even considered. That’s another thing I enjoyed about working there. I had a lot of support from my supervisor to move or apply for new opportunities within the firm. Deloitte will not hold you back from growing your career.  As a matter of fact, they encourage you to grow!
ProsTons of free food and flexible schedules
Sales credit program sound great but not always followed. Some leaders will take sales credit from some and give to those they have targeted for promotion.  Many at the partnership level treat it as a secret brotherhood who refuse to accept the possibility one of their brothers could do anything...untoward.
ProsGreat payConsarrogant leaders who frequently remind you its so much harder to get into Harvard!!!
Things started off ok but then I immediately knew that I wouldn't be there long. The supervisor they brought in was in way over his head... I was lead to believe i was being groomed for the position but nope pulled in a total stranger and changed the whole culture. 
ProsGood co workersConsLow pay, and blame falls heavy on employees...
They hire you with claims that you will do a certain job  but when you start they tell you they dont have any positions for that skill set. This place is to much of a cult
There was nothing bad to report - great place to work. Management would provide lunch for no particular reason, then sit and eat with their team. This made things more personal.
ProsEach year one day working in community pro bono..ConsNone comes to mind.
Great place to launch a career. The company provides sufficient resources and training to help you success. Good benefit. Stressful during busy season. 
Deloitte needs to evolve rapidly. Old-fashioned management and bad people practices are affecting innovation, adaptability, trust, and commitment. Slow processes, burocracy, invisible leadership, keep making great talent go away.
ProsTrends research, access to knowledge, exciting world class projects.ConsLack of transparency, support, and recognition. Most of leaders are not role models.
The people are smart and most of the projects are staff aug for federal. You have the opportunity to learn a lot and obtain experience working in many different industries.  
ProsBrandConsSenior Leadership team disconnected from delivery teams
Working on the federal side of consulting, you may think that it's more boring than the commercial side. During my time at Deloitte, I was able to work on interesting and meaningful projects and was able to be part of some great teams. You need to be intentional about creating a work/life balance because that can easily get lost in the shuffle.
ProsGreat colleagues and meaningful workConsEasy to lose a sense of work/life balance
No work life balance. You will work 80 hours a week and be stressed out constantly. No work lice balance you literally always working. pay is not enough ti other jobs.
Had no real sense of purpose in my internship and came away without really learning anything. Did not feel like my hard work into projects and work was not appreciated and very hard to switch businesses within Deloitte.

Bad environment. Bad work/life balance. Comp is terrible for the amount of work. Very political. Advancement is slotted. Most of the best people leave.
There's always work to do if you like always working. Some of the of the people who work there are amazing; however, they tend to leave the firm after a few years. 
Pros-COLLEAGUES: Many colleagues I've worked on my projects are some of the best people I have the pleasure of working with-PROJECT VARIETY: Firm is very large and has its hands in nearly all industries around the world. If one is able to navigate the bureaucracy, the variety of projects that one can do is immenseCons-PROJECT STAFFING: Since the firm is very large, many of the project staffing teams are overburdened. This leads to an over-reliance on networking and informal staffing to find a project that is of interest and right for your skillset. -PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT: The Performance management system factors for which one is evaluated is very opaque and is highly dependent on the partners input on whether they know and like the practitioner. To wit, I've known colleagues who appeared excellent on the evaluation factors which are visible to them but have been evaluated poorly, or even fired in a few cases, due to little partner support.-COMPENSATION & BENEFITS: Compensation is lower than what other strategy consulting firms offer and, while Deloitte offers a 401k match, the firm only matches ~1.5% of salary of which is 100% vested at 4 years.
ProsColleagues, Project VarietyConsProject Staffing, Performance Management, Compensation
The name didn't live up to my expectations. Most importantly, I expected honesty from start to finish. I was lured in to do a job I was completely unaware of in the Baltimore location. The job duties were inconsistent with the information and incentives articulated in the interview. They were about scouting HIGHLY qualified personnel, luring them in to get a body in seat and you found out the truth once you get settled in after day 3 or so. The work was easy; however, I was over qualified for the day to day task. The job duties were more fitting of someone who is a Beginner in the field 
High-school culture (e.g. gossip, drama, etc.), horrid pay, you're seen and treated as expendable by the firm (pre and post-covid, tons of reading material on this). Your primary engagement team can make or break your experience. If you luck out, great. If not, you'll probably either quit within the first year or get shown the door. 
Tech consulting at Deloitte was my first job out of college. Onboarding, advancement, and support from management were fantastic. It's a large company, but within your own special they try to promote a small company feel. I burned out quickly on projects that required weekly travel from the west coast to the east coast. Management was very supportive, but they can only help so much in that situation. I also didn't set boundaries for work life balance and leadership didn't provide a great example of setting boundaries (most of my managers were overworked, despite encouraging me to unplug once in a while). I stayed with Deloitte for 3 years before leaving to pursue a career change. 
ProsGreat support from management, good people to work withConsNeed to set strong boundaries to manage work/life balance
Very Bad Company. All-day maintaining existing product. There were no good engineers overall. Poor management expected to work on weekends and till late 10:00pm simply for maintaining product.Only good thing is they gave us dinner. 
ProsNothingConsEverything
Deloitte is a big company and wants their employees to manage their own career which is great. But, the downfall to this model is when it comes to working for external clients projects. It is very chaotic and if you're are not on top of your game you can get lost and struggle. I was able to strive because of how many hours I had to put out to make sure I succeed. The company is not for everyone, but if you are just starting your career, this can be a great environment to learn how to manage your career, learn to become a leader, and learn soft skills that will be valuable down the line in your career. But, if you are a seasoned senior professional, besides the money, I don't know what else would be attractive.   
ProsDecent pay, benefits, great co-workersConsWork/Life balance, Clients, performance structure, work assignment structure
I've learned a lot in a short period of time.  Work-life balance is clearly important to the firm, but high stress is definitely a part of the job.  Really great culture but I have heard that varies office to office within the EFA practice.
Company is not reliable. Will not stand at your difficult times. If you are high billable resource then you have to work atleast 14hrs/day including weekends. Additionally you might have to work with overseas team at different time zones. 
ProsAmerican ExpressConsWork life Balance
The firm offers great benefits, 23 days of PTO, family leave for the birth of a child or to take care of your family. A lot of perks and incentives. However, there is no work life balance. A lot of working hours. 
More work pressure and compensation benefits are not great.Will learn more as consultants work with different client and get a chance to undertsand different business process
Not bad, but can be done better in terms of an increased salary, more benefits, and better IT infrastructure. Still, one of the good companies out there to start your career with.
People at Deloitte always say that you can make your career what you want at Deloitte.  You can try different types of projects and learn about so many different things.  The pay and benefits are good and I enjoy the culture.  The trainings are also great.
I loved working for Deloitte! Everyone was very helpful and patient. There was always someone available to ask questions and guide you with a new task. I was working on a temporary project for the health department with the COVID-19.
Great place to learn and grow tech wise. WLB is horrible (depending on the project). Pay is decent but can be better. Work from home is terrible at this company 
ProsGood for new grass if they wanna learnConsWlB Terrible
I have been very lucky to work with compassionate, motivated, brilliant people on my teams over the years, but the demand for work continues to outpace the willingness of the company to staff projects appropriately or manage client expectations for fast deadlines, fire drills, etc. Those with in-demand technical skills or a passion for very fast-paced project management will thrive here, but I am no longer finding the lifestyle to be sustainable. 
Senior roles are ridiculous, no work life balance, unrealistic expectation and working in a delivery center leaves you without any substantial maternity benefits, and subpar benefits and salary in general.
A great deal of self promoting both inside and out. Spend more time tracking the work and talking about how great it is but very little executing. Good place to learn how to be a professional but can become difficult to change paths once you get stuck in a rut.
ProsGood Pay, benefits and perksConsHard to define how to get promoted and always feel inadequate and like you haven’t done enough.
Culture depends largely on the team you're on. Compensation is low for the industry, however the breadth of experiences you can have if you go after them at the company are great. The network when you leave that can be gained here is invaluable. 
Had no real sense of purpose in my internship and came away without really learning anything. Did not feel like my hard work into projects and work was not appreciated and very hard to switch businesses within Deloitte.
Prosfree lunches, nice bonus, free timeConsnot purposeful
Team is good fun and relaxed. Work is challenging at times however you have the ability to take on less work if you wish. Always have the abity to learn new things.
Nothing positive to say about my experience there outside of the relationships I fostered with my peers. Salary is below market, training and development was non-existent and I was loaned out 80% of the time to projects completely unrelated to my field.
ProsFoster strong relationships with people you start with.ConsToo many to list
I worked with a highly capable group within Deloitte that was cohesive and very well managed. The focus was on completing time-sensitive tasks at all costs and providing high quality work product and service. Work-life balance was challenging when we were working on live deals, but that was expected and also energizing.
Expectations are high but this is what you sign up for. The burn out can get very real and you need to make sure you have a strong network to back you up when things hit the fan.
Hours are flexible - easy to schedule time for doctor appts or vacations. Considerable holiday time given. Bonuses are never as high as might be expected, but pretty good. 
ProsGreat comp
The company provides useful training sessions and is involved in complex projects. It helps you develop both soft and technical skills. The hardest part of the job is projects with tight deadlines.
great work life balance if you find the right panrtner to work for. there is no support at sr mgr though. at sr mgr you kind of need to either be in it for ppmd track or leave asap. 
You have to charter your own path. Work depends on the project and so does the team and people you work with. Long or short hours dependent on the project
You're afforded the opportunity to work on interesting assignments, travel to different clients, understand their business, and work with the smartest, most balanced, and fun people in business. Definitely best place to start your career
ProsVariety of clients in different industries, people, travelConslong hours are a possiblity but only during the busy season
At Deloitte, I had the opportunity to work with smart, motivated, and interesting colleagues and clients. It was a great place to launch my career as I was involved in a number of projects and industries.
Although I am no longer an employee, my experience working at Deloitte was very positive and I learned so much. It was a privilege to work with the best in the industry. 
Deloitte is an excellent place to work. It empowers you to own your career. You can try differen roles and industries and find your fit. It rewards talent greatly, and offers unparalleled growth.
ProsGreat culture
Interesting department to intern at. Management was not very social or engaging. There is a lot of mobility and a range of different departments to switch over to once you have put in your time.
It is a company that existed for long. I did find below as a detriment over the past 5 years.- Delivery centers as complementary to consulting, but using them more during Covid .. representing them as part of consulting equivalent, to make margins happen- Project delivery workforce is a tough spot for people to survice- Covid cuts, did a bad job of these
Proswellness perks, leave of absenceConsBad covid cuts, Struggle to execute tech outcomes
Great work culture and full of opportunities. Benefits are good compared to other firms. A little bit costly health insurance by keeping in mind the stature of the company,
ProsA lot of opportunitiesConstoo much workload
Stressful long hours less clarity politicsGreat training clients comp is fine good projects fitness subsidies Good for homegrown talent not good for exp hires 
Busy season was horrible. Crazy hours no thanks.If you are lucky the summers are better,That’s only if someone has your back. Could be the same again with June year end dates 
ProsGood experienceConsCrazy work load
Pros-smart people, good overall company culture, job security if perform decently at lower levelsCons-work life balance generally with consulting (federal practice is more sustainable), competitive pay, interesting projects
Everybody was run down and overworked. Does not excite me as a place to work and grow. Definite job security, however, and plenty of opportunities to advance.
Work extra hours with no recognition. Big workload, team leads don’t care about you. The only way to grow in the company is being best buddy of the leadership.
ProsExposure to clientsConsNo lunch break, low pay, no career perspective
Had no real sense of purpose in my internship and came away without really learning anything. Did not feel like my hard work into projects and work was not appreciated and very hard to switch businesses within Deloitte.
Prosfree lunches, nice bonus, free timeConsnot purposeful
Great company to work for as a recent college grad. I've worked at the company for about three years now, and this has been an amazing first job out of college. However, if you're someone in the tech field, the compensation isn't that great. You're really not earning that much until you reach Manager level. Work life balance can be great, but you really have to advocate for yourself. 
Company who delivery very complex and important engagement for their clients and make them successful . Client. Typically engage us when they feel their carrier would be risk if projects does not get delivered. 
ProsFree food, most talented peopleConsWorking Hours, Compensation
Office space is open concept (pre-Corona Virus).  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with.   Made many great connections while with Deloitte.
"I worked in the Deloitte Federal space so my work/life balance may be different to those in private sector practice. Overall, I would say the quality of people working at Deloitte is its greatest asset. Managers genuinely try to ""set you up for success."" Deloitte also encourages and has a system that allows you to find work that is most meaningful/interesting to you. Again, in Federal at least work/life balance was very good. "
ProsPeople, work variety, work/life balanceConsnot specific to Deloitte but consulting industry
Deloitte has a lot of great benefits and the people within the firm were really cool. Unfortunately for me, I experienced that in places outside of my Advisory practice. Upper management in my team was super toxic.
Company is very focused on their profits rather than accommodating the needs of their employees. It is a great place to network but is exhausting to keep up with their compliance metrics.
ProsGreat benefitsConsExtremely demanding
This is definitely a challenging and at times stressful career. However, you learn so much and there is a plethora of opportunity at all times. Colleagues are incredibly bright and you are paid very well for your time and energy. Must be self-directed and highly motivated to succeed. 
Decent job. I would recommend to others. I just felt that it is no longer a good fit for me. Working from home and talking on the phone and on the computer all day is getting old. 
Unlimited opportunities to take your career in whatever direction aligns with your interests. Highly matrixed organization that can be overwhelming and challenging to navigate. High expectations with experience dependent on the team you are aligned with.
Great company to build a long term career path if you're an A type personality. Very result oriented, and the way your every minute of productivity is tracked and the way your performance is evaluated can sometimes make you feel like just another dot on a line graph. But other than that you have great job security, benefits, and long term career potential. 
ProsPrestigious and you learn a lot quicklyConsCan be stressful at times and you will have high work loads
I enjoy this job as my first job -- I think it's a great place to learn and develop your business skillset because the opportunities are literally endless within the firm. They give you the chance to pave your own road to learn more about the things you're interested in and energized by.
ProsLearning opportunities, challenged, growth minded company that cares to develop employeesConsLong hours at times, can get stressful as well if you don't manage up on expectations/time
I have never before worked in such an unprofessional environment.  Management constantly misses or cancels meetings at the last minute.  Team members and management go on leave without communicating their absence.  Objectives are not communicated until after a deliverable has been turned in.  Working nights, weekends, and holidays is expected - and generally needed for leadership's lack of time management.  Cancel culture runs rampant through every level of management and leadership.  Work-life balance is a joke.  Utilization (percentage of billable hours per 2080 work-hours per year) is expected to meet or exceed 95%.  Any PTO or holiday hours are counted against that utilization rate, making it impossible to meet that goal without working in excess of 50 hours a week every week.  Pay isn't bad but, if taking into consideration the hours needed to maintain your job, hourly rates are much lower than most non-consulting corporations.
Prosno prosConslack of work-life balance, terrible corporate culture, unprofessional management
The only pro is that you build resume for your next jobTHats it. Other than that you will work so many hours, and be paid so very little. If you can have another job, go ahead and leave deloitte as a last resource
ProsresumeConslow salaries
I was hired as a “project delivery” senior analyst without any real knowledge of how that effects your ability to be promoted or grow as an employee. 
ProsFree lunch, overall supportive managementConsDeceitful hiring practices
Junior analysts / consultants drawn from undergraduate institutions. Much diversity and inclusion. DU is an excellent start to ones tenure and is a great place to network and build connections. 
ProsGenerous benefitsConsWorking lunches
If you are a hard worker and high performer, there are countless opportunities for you. You must enjoy a fast pace.  The flexibility is unmatched.  The PTO is unmatched (and yes you can use it). The maternity/paternity leave is unmatched.  Truly an “own your own career” mentality with no “boss” per se.  You can get stuck in a rut working for a partner/director that doesn’t fulfill you.  That’s the biggest challenge - more difficult to make people moves without direct conversations but still much easier than in industry!
ProsFamily leave, nice offices, countless resources to do your jobCons401(k) match
Great place to work, I was a Recruiter on the sourcing team and I started as a contractor and converted to full-time. Get approval to convert to full-time was difficult even though I was leading my team in production. There seemed to be always an excuse and I felt like I was reaching m racing for the carrot always in front of me. I always worked extra hours to make sure my production was great, but when speaking to my manager I never received a clear vision of what I could feel into.
ProsRemote work, good pay, excellent benefitsConsWork-life balance, career path
"Deloitte has it all. Great clients, great teams, opportunities to keep learning, amazing training, and great perks. If you know where you want to go in your career, there is a way forward at this firm. If you don't, there is time to figure it out. With that being said, you do have to put in long hours depending on your group. Utilization and client service hours are always metrics that you will have to meet and it can be very demanding at times. Most teams (I'm in tax) will have a ""whatever the client wants"" mentality which can translate into a toxic work environment where working till midnight and getting back online at 6 am is the norm. It's magnified even more that everyone is working from home. In order to keep our clients happy sometimes upper management will agree to unreasonable deadlines causing well being and mental health to suffer.  As much as this is a great firm, i have been stressed at this job since day 1. It is not for the faint of heart. There are definitely good days and moments but in the end, you have to determine for yourself what you want your personal life and work look like. If ""putting in the work"" and ""grinding"" is something you're willing to do, this is a great place to learn and grow! I've seen many people come to love the firm and their career and sure that will continue despite the personal sacrifices. "
Prostraining, various career paths, great benefits, promotion schedule, ability to be on many clients and gain new experiences, meeting amazing peopleConslong hours, low pay for the amount of hours you put in
Typical big 4 job,  intense hours but good experience. Pay was ok since I was an experienced hire but the raised were kind of meh, around 3-4%. Culture really varies depending on your team.
I started at Deloitte straight out of college as a Business Technology Analyst. I loved it for my first two years and got stuck on back-to-back bad projects that really ruined my outlook on the firm. Junior-level promotions are all about time in the level (2 years BTA/BA, 3 years Consultant) with very little leeway even if you're already operating at the next level. The firm also robbed its employees of the 2020 raises and bonuses, and is now suffering the consequences by losing a lot of top talent to companies who will pay them appropriately (myself included).If you're looking for a place to work hard, meet awesome people, and learn a lot quickly, Deloitte is the place to go. If you're looking for a place  where leadership does what they say they'll do (from middle management all the way to the C-Suite), then I'd recommend looking elsewhere. 
ProsFantastic people, lots of learning opportunities, meritocracyConsWork/Life balance, leadership sticking to their word, promotion cycles, overall compensation
Had no real sense of purpose in my internship and came away without really learning anything. Did not feel like my hard work into projects and work was not appreciated and very hard to switch businesses within Deloitte.
Prosfree lunches, nice bonus, free timeConsnot purposeful
I really liked working for Deloitte. They are a stand up company who I felt was always there to support my success. It is contract work so not long term but I would work for them again in a heart beat because they want their people to succeed and produce results for the companies we work with. 
ProsGood compensationConsLong shifts
Constantly being pushed to do the impossible within unrealistic target dates.  Work 60+ hours every week.  Average pay (at best) with no paid overtime and bonuses reserved for managers' pets.   Expect to work most weekends - great place if you want to avoid your family.
ProsBetter than being unemployeedConsLong hours and no overtime pay
Good business culture, diversity and training. Career evaluation and advancement is not so clear. Deloitte provides very good services to large clients but is too expensive for medium sized businesses.
ProsWork from homeConsHR evaluation system
expect long hours and high pressure most of the time since they have a time sheet system which people will see how much the billable hours are each wee which pretty much sucks
Deloitte was consumed with employees satisfaction and quality of life.  There was also a sense of driving metrics through personal engagement which allowed teams to develop and execute individual business value.  This was the most progressive and professionally focused company I have worked for.
Pro: Great benefits and PTOThe people are hard working and qualifiedEncourages study and developmentCon: Long hoursExperience varies with team assignment. Few choice in choosing what you want in the beginning
Love the team atmosphere.  It was a great culture and I feel like I fit in almost immediately. Challenging work environment which tested me each day..
Prepare to not have a life for awhile. You will be working minimum of 55-60 hours a week. Low compensation and people are very cut throat. Definitely regret working here.
ProsNoneConsA lot
Overall, Deloitte is a good place to work especially for career advancement. The people I work with are very nice and the technology is solid. Can be overly bureaucratic though. 
Not a great firm to work for. The overall support and training that was provided was not what I expected from a Big 4 Firm.  I had work for ten years with another Big 4 and they we far superior with regards to training and support.
"Horrible culture. Rampant nepotism. The first questions a new employee is asked (by current employees) is ""who do you know that works here"". Because everyone knows someone who works their. A relative, a friend of a relative, a frat brother/sister, etc. Then, they end up working with their friends/family, who write glowing performance reviews for them. The few who don't know anyone end up working with the people nobody wants to work with. The people who do work there aren't nearly as smart as people assume, they have been coasting on that reputation for a while. It is all about who you know to get in, then all about who you know in industry to secure additional clients. Of course the hours during busy season are horrible, 55+ charge hours are mandatory. Don't calculate your hourly pay during these times, it's not worth it."
"ProsThe company lavishly wastes money on travel, free food, etc. They probably spent 15k on travel and hotels for ""training"" my internship and first year, all of which could've been done remotely for next to nothing.ConsTerrible pay for the hours worked. Rampant favortism."
I have met amazing team mates here, and was presented with many learning opportunities. The company is structured, the projects are vasts.  This is a great company as a beginning stepping stone for professionals.
"The company is great to work for and comes with the benefits of working for a large consulting firm. Pay is on par and work is very interesting. The only downfall is that they have started a whole ""offshore"" model inside the US that they call ""delivery centers"" which cater to low-cost consulting. The work isn't very interesting and it's definitely not consulting work and feels pretty mundane. "
ProsGood payConsLeadership doesnt care enough about you.
People are great and supportive. You can make great connections here and the alumni usually went to nice companies for exit. The projects are usually not what you can decide though especially earlier in your career, you might not work on the type of projects that you interviewed for or interested in. I know many people got pulled into data entry type of projects where you don't learn anything. Might just be me but the salary is not good comparing to the market rate, sometimes fresh grad can make higher salaries than their seniors who have more experiences which don't help when the turnover rate is already pretty high.
ProsGreat people, nice benefitsConsWork life balance, salary
People focused culture that strives to meet employees ' needs and balances personal and professional goals. Changing technology landscape and the environment to meet these challenges. 
ProsContinuous learning
I am extremely satisfied with my experience at the firm because of all the benefits and strong leadership. I feel that my opinion is valued and I can make an impact on my teams.
ProsBenefits, esp. PTOConsNot many that I can think of
Deloitte has been supportive professionally and personally. From onboarding to even transitioning outside the company, Deloitte supports their people on every level. They have been a great company to work for and hope that our paths cross again in the future.
Bean counters. Don't pay people what they're worth. Benefits are meh. They spend a lot of time talking up the company culture, unfortunately it's all talk. 
Best Company compare to others best in salary ,work time, Holidays , promotions , paper less work 70% work is easy full digital nice to work here. Good overall.
Typical consulting firm and model, and pay is competitive with the MBB firms. Suffers from typical consulting industry issues: work-life balance and constant travel, namely. People are on the whole intelligent and enjoyable to work with. Like other firms, it's an up or out model, so most leave, but you'll leave with lots of skills to apply elsewhere.

Deloitte has a good methodology and structure that it is a good place to start a career. I wouldn’t have had a problem staying and wouldn’t mind going back. I left for opportunity that was on the ground floor of a new initiative. 
ProsBenefits, teams, flexibility, stability
Amazing place, wish we were still there and not at home.  Great people great culture, great training but with WFH no where near an end, it is time to look elsewhere.
Its a great place to begin your career but the best project opportunities are limited by who you know. I always felt like a cog in a wheel rather than a valued asset.
ProsGood perks, high starting salaryConsSmall raises, inconsistent review process
18 years with Deloitte and loved it all. Diversity, inclusion, and equality are common words at Deloitte. Life-time friends and support from share holders was so comforting. Always encouraged to go the extra mile and mentoring program and promoting to a new role was highly recommended. Would love to return!
ProsSee aboveConsNa
Good starting place for a career in accounting or Finance. Staffing matters, as well as the mentorships you receive. I did 3 years and went to industry, which I recommend.

Prosknowledge experienceConsextensive travel
I love working here great management. IfYou want to advance quickly then you should really put in the work to impress the partner in the engagement so they know who you are 
Deloitte creates a fantastic environment to work for. The culture is fast paced and expects it's consultants to deliver high quality work, but every practitioner I have come across is extremely helpful and will do what they can to help. I have not worked for a company with a more positive environment than Deloitte. 
Working at Deloitte is amazing. You have the opportunity to know many people coming from different countries. the only flaw is the work-life balance. 
High on politics and place where people will try to make sure you work and they get appreciated.Work timings are very bad for offshore and onshore people rule like kings
ProsFair pay, Work diversityConsImproper project planning that affects Mental health
Hard fit if you come from a traditional business background.  You have to learn Deloitte culture from the ground up very quickly in order to blend well with other team members.
ProsGood SalaryConsLots of competition within the organization
Good networking, learning opportunities but insane hours at times. Get to work with people your age and very collaborative. It’s a good first experience. 
Deloitte pays well but squeezes every ounce of energy from the employees. The hours are long and arduous, often times there are “fires” for something that isn’t urgent. Many leaders believe they are hired onto a contract to do what the client says instead of being a true consultant and advising the client on their best options or speaking up to provide insights and recommendations that would help the client and organization. I have not been on a project where I felt the work was done well and added value. I felt it was more of a waste of federal tax dollars. Good benefits, but the high stress and constant over-engagement, networking, firm initiatives on top of a 50+ hour work week, and the time commitment / expectations are simply too much and unhealthy.
ProsBenefits, payConsHigh stress, lack of respect for personal time, constant pressure to engage and network
Recently benefits have been cut and salary at US firms have been frozen, no increases in over a year. Medical premiums have increased over 20% and 401(k) benefits are very below average. 
It is no secret that you will certainly work a lot... As with every client-service job, the push is for hours. In public accounting, there are never enough hours in January, February or March. However, the rest of the year is relatively structured around 8-10 hour days. There is an exception to every rule: Some of my colleagues had busy-seasons every quarter. So those hours got overwhelming and they burned out quickly.Despite this, at the end of the day, you are clearly at another level than your industry oriented peers. After a few years in audit, it would come as no surprise if you were hired as the manager of someone your own age who went straight into corporate accounting.
This wasn't the place for me. Managers are terrible and there are a lot of toxic people that work here. Most of the time they're complaining about something instead of working. 
Have loved starting my career here, great place to learn and make connections. However, the pay is not on par with my expectations and goes up very little from year to year. Additionally, when team members leave, senior team members do a terrible job of finding replacements and expect you to pick up all the slack.
ProsFlexible work location, great travel if you want itConsOverworked staff, inadequate pay
Co-workers are given a lot of onsite training keeping everyone updated on all software needed.  Easy advancement time plan for non admins.  Parsippany, NJ is a great office set up with areas to eat, a cafe, a gym, plenty of parking, and a nice walking path that goes around a pond. 
Prosworking with the PPMDs & HealthcareCons2020 downsizing
"I work in the core operations in creative services. My little corner of this world has severely gone down hill with recent changes in management. Before these changes, management had creative experience - all used to be designers or at least knew with how to run a design team. My day-to-day was sort of boring but the benefits and work from home policies(even pre-covid) were nice enough to keep me here for several years. Now, we are lead by people with no design experience whatsoever. The culture has changed completely. My entire day is now heavily tracked, scrutinized and if I don't show agreeable ""numbers"", my performance score goes down. There are some things I'm tracked on that I don't even have control over that will count against me. Nothing makes sense anymore. Biggest issues: we don't have enough designers and the project scheduling tool we used to have has been replaced with a literal Excel sheet for an entire global team to use (it's as horrible and glitchy as you'd think it would be). All in all, it's a bad experience working here right now. It didn't used to be but I wouldn't recommend this place anymore under current leadership. "
ProsRelative job securityConsNo room for advancement, bad management
An amazing place to start your career. Gives you great opportunities to learn and advance in your career.great opportunities in different roles and locations
ProsCultureConsHectic
Had no real sense of purpose in my internship and came away without really learning anything. Did not feel like my hard work into projects and work was not appreciated and very hard to switch businesses within Deloitte.
Prosfree lunches, nice bonus, free timeConsnot purposeful
Deloitte is a great place to work with teams who are good at their skills. The work-life balance is great and the management is good. The paid time off is generous.
Very smart, very capable people from some of the best universities in the world.  I learned a lot.  Great variety of work.  Sophisticated clients.  Lots of room to grow and get promoted.  Good salary.  This was the best job I've ever had.
ProsSmart people, good learning opportunityConsSometimes long hours
I have issues with employees at Deloitte. The work culture is awesome, where I felt appreciated by the teams work. I would recommend Deloitte to anyone; entry or experienced. 
ProsGood BenefitsConsWork / Life Balance
great management that cares about your goals, amazing company culture with lots of PTOs, easygoing coworkers who are always open to having discussions and helping you find a team with a better fit if needed
ProsCaring and compassionate co-workersConsnot necessarily a lot of job growth
"Network network network! You get work through your network, not the resource manager. You get sponsors for promotions and special assignments through your network. Your network is asked for feedback for performance reviews. Experienced hires struggle in this environment because they don't ""grow up"" in the system like campus hires do and don't have a ready-made network of a bunch of people who graduated with you and joined the firm at the same time. Work-life balance is fine in certain areas, not so much in others, depends on the projects you have, your leadership, and your clients. Also depends on the boundaries you set and enforce. Benefits are great. There's a lot of things you can do and learn, IF you've built the right network across different areas to be able to move around and someone will advocate for you - it's not as easy as they claim it is. Lots of management changes over the 5 years I was there meant lots of changes in strategy and focus. New management likes a new system, so we have to install it and replace something that was working fine. Newer management likes something else? Replace it! New management came from finance background? Financial work is now the primary strategic focus. Newer management has a tech background? Change strategy to technology innovation! Doesn't seem like they want to wait for anything to really take hold and produce results. Overall, if you get on a good team, it's fun and is a great place to hone consulting skills. If you don't, it will be rough. "
ProsBenefits. PTO policy. Flexible work schedule. Great colleagues in certain areas.ConsVariable bonus based on an undisclosed formula, performance review process.
Overall happy with Deloitte. I have great work life balance and the culture is great. Leadership listens and helps team up to resolve any conflicts. We'll being is a HUGE deal. Compensation could be better. 
ProsCurrent WFH, work life balance, cultureConsCompensation is low in my opinion for the work that is required
Deloitte as a whole is a good company to work for. The company's reputation is solid and its really good to have them on your resume. Deloitte is a really good place to expand your skills. There are plenty of opportunities to learn cutting-edge technology if you take advantage. 
ProsGreat place to learn cutting edge technologyConsLack of true diversity
I've worked at Deloitte for a total of 6 years, was a boomerang. I've had good opportunities but pay hasn't been great over the past few years also not always working with the best and brightest. 
Typical day of work: would go in to gov’t client and sit in a conference room all day. Partners don’t care about people, managers are over-worked. Really helps if you have a great team and mentor. 
ProsExpensed Starbucks, $500 health benefit, great younger workforceConsTerrible hours, cut-throat coworkers, and politics
I strongly believe that there is a nationalism running in full throttle! But if you can maintain a strong networking with the senior management level, there's a good chance you could survive that culture. I  didn't get career advancement support as much as I needed/wanted to move myself up in the ladder just because I didn't speak the dominant language in the workplace. But higher management that doesn't fall into a certain geography could be your good guides. I took a pay cut when I joined the company. Bonus was fine with other incentives like Well Being Program. Overall, it's not a bad place to work if you can fit in with other than your expertise. 
ProsGood IT support, safe workplace, opportunities to get involved in community servicesConsStrong nationalism, lack of training in your area of expertise, pay increase.
Deloitte its the perfect company to work for. The benefits package are excellent, however the salary is not as high as you would think you will make. 
ProsFree lunches, events, wellbeing package, full benefits packages, paternal leave 4 months.Constakes a while for a new role to open but is worth to wait.
Management was generally unsupportive and often turned on staff for their own career advancement. But this is all to be expected I guess. Just know what you are getting into. 
I initially did not know how to place Deloitte when i started as a UX designer for deloitte digital. The design practice was accomplished but also young at the time and finding a firm footing in the firm. With a focus on people and the client, which is often our priority as designers, I felt the initial years be more about advocacy both internally and externally. And folks at Deloitte are great listeners, you can be new but if you have  reasoning you can really chart your own way most of the time. You will get to also work with people from all over the world, and the USA. So making sure you can make folks comfortable etc can go a long way, whether its people in your own team or outside of it. If you have issues with people there are many resources to help you as well and maybe the other person too. Growing in the firm is all about rallying folks to a vision, that vision can be anything, a new practice or a product or framework and evangelizing it so others can use it to succeed in their engagements.
ProsGood culture around inclusivity, Easy to be heard, access to great set of tools for the most part. Good remote work infrastructure.ConsPublic portfolio grows intellectually as opposed to in technical design work.
I was lucky to get into a role that helps me develop the skills that I care about. Deloitte is amazing at being open to listening to my desires and career goals. I would note to say that it is very individual driven so if you don't really know what you're looking for, it's going to be more difficult to find your niche.
ProsPrimarily remote, open communication, great benefitsConsVery rigid policies, initial starting pay can be low, long hours depending on business
Good Company for consulting Work/Life balance depends on the projectNot a place for technical folksSurrounded by smart peopleSometimes its difficult to navigate office politics
Theres a lot of favoritism  and its about who you knowVery long hours and unable to take leave when you need to.Very highly  pressurised environment
Your success heavily depends on your manager's investment in you, and finding some colleagues to help you navigate Deloitte.  If you don't have a good manager at first, find a better one fast.
ProsGreat benefits.ConsManagers can make you or break you.
Deloitte is a professional services company with a strong legal viewpoint to avoid conflict of interest of partners and employees.  I worked in high value management consulting Services.  Larger enfasis in growing the IT part of the business, but the possibilities depend on leaderships vision locally.  Networking in and out of Deloitte is critical.  Passive professionals will have problems as they move up the ladder.
ProsProfessional opportunities and internal mobilityConsLack of leadership can be a game breaker.
Deloitte is probably the best place I have ever worked. Most of the leadership is very helpful and I have rarely heard people say they thought it was a bad place to work.
ProsLots of support, work from home, plenty of pto and training.ConsCan't think of any.
"Been here for 5 years. Great firm, but not a place for over achievers. New CEO comes from 30 years in government and firmly believes in equality and fairness over performance. Everything is being socialized rather than promoting meritocracy. Likewise, those with more tenure despite being horrible at their jobs will always get priority consideration over a rock star for promotions. This could be a great place if you like normalcy, balance, and stability and just like sticking it out. You will definitely be upset if you are a high performer because your rewards will still be similar to those ""just sticking it out."""
Had no real sense of purpose in my internship and came away without really learning anything. Did not feel like my hard work into projects and work was not appreciated and very hard to switch businesses within Deloitte.

ProsPeoplesConsWork-life balance
Your success depends on the team you’re in. experience hires usually suffer from lack of networking. Very liberal firm.  culture, job security, comp is very localized within your group. Being senior level boomerang with decent tenure but still struggled with sponsorship from leadership. Work pressure is high consistent with consulting,  comp w bonus is better than others. Overall Good prospect firm for college hires who can stick with firm for long time 
There are a lot of opportunities to learn and also volunteer for non- technical work if you are interested. I liked that we had 1 day to volunteer and give back to the society. Work can get crazy sometimes and people are not respectful of your time when you are out sick.
ProsPTO is 5 weeks, get week off for ChristmasConsSometimes leadership is not open about what is going on. Also, your experience is based on the teams you are part of. There are some managers that don’t care.
great company and benefits - need to be a strong networker to get assignments and see success, it can be done but coming in I was working in a different city than much of my team and struggled with this
I had a great time working with Deloitte as a summer intern. The team was very nice, energetic and inclusive. Tremendous amount of resources for personal/professional development. I did not learn that much during my short term though. (but it was during the pandemic...) I strongly recommend this employer! 
Prosgreat culture, talents, team work, flexible scheduleConsinternal competition
The private partnership model is cut throat.   Advancement is based on what you bring into the partnership.  They could care less about the individuals.  You can make a lot of money but it is not a nurturing environment. 
ProsIncomeConsCold empty environment.
"As IT manager/sysadmin for the Management Consulting practice's SF office, the challenges were there at every moment, which is extremely satisfying, as long as you have the ability to keep up.  There's an operational separation between support staff and the actual (""client billing"") professionals.  The latter are typically top-20 school MBAs and experts in their fields (healthcare, research, business, technology, etc.) and they operate as lawyers might - with billing rates in the hundreds of dollars per hour, so each instant of their time has a dollar sign associated.   However, they strive to operate as a meritocracy, so they appreciate those who can keep up intellectually.  But, it's a capitalistic money-making operation, so nearly everyone is on an up-or-out treadmill.  Either you succeed and get promoted to another level, or you are ""counseled out"" if you've plateaued.  In my case, our team built an entire global enterprise infrastructure for divestiture of the Consulting practice.  However, the financing of the operation fell apart and those of us who were managing the hundreds-of-millions of dollars of a stillborn company were instantly redundant.  Disappointing.  But, the severance package was generous and the firm provided support for my family's health challenges for another year (COBRA).  It's a marathon experience, but highly exhilarating.  If you are a high-achiever, this is a great place to make substantial contributions, and compete alongside, and against, top-level talent."
ProsSilicon Valley amenities: some free lunches, pool table (at the time), espresso machines, etc.ConsSupport staff are typically expendable, if the economy suffers. But that's true eveywhere.
Deloitte is a great place to work if you want to get into consulting. Consulting is not generally a balanced lifestyle no matter where you work, but the Deloitte environment is incredibly supportive with resources to support you no matter what.
Love the company - it offers a fair and respectful yet competitive environment and expects much in return. One must adapt and be proficient in job. You must always strive to do better and be a team player or run the risk of being looked upon as a low performer. 
ProsBenefits, IT support, inclusive work environmentConsHigh Pressure
Good experience deal with a lot of deals/clients. They provide great training, very insightful depending on your group. Compensation good just not equivalent to the amount of hours and travel dedicated to the position.
Prosexperience, training, compensationConshigh volume, work life balance
Good company but difficult to manage others in the ever changing personnel!Difficult to communicate with associates and secretarial support!Hierarchy not understandable!  Who reports to who and the cross relationships!
ProsFlexibleConsToo much work! Had to have work/life balance!
Good place to start a career if you aren't sent on something. They will offer you opportunities to grow and learn, which is not something available at all companies at this scale.
ProsCareer growthConsLong hours, Jack of All Trades
I did the internship during busy season. It's a great opportunity to learn about auditing and the corporate culture. You won't regret spending time at Deloitte.
I had a wonderful time at the location in Hermitage. Friendly co-workers I  love the free coffee. The location was a beautiful secure location and I was very impressed.

Been with Deloitte for around 7yrs. Great Company to work for. Diverse projects and lots of opportunity to learn new things. Benefits need improvement. 
ProsGreat peopleConsWork-life balance
"Deloitte is a great place to start a career, not necessarily a destination. Lots to learn earlier on in your career to develop your problem solving skills. Meritocracy in that you get what you put in. However, a lot of times, it's who you know, rather than what you know, that determines your success. Year end evaluation are based on what Partners / Principals / Directors are willing to say of you, rather than your true skillsets. Opinions / chest pounding dominate. Burn out occur quite often. Need to work smart, not necessarily hard. Smart might mean ""leveraging"" others, which is just shifting responsibilities and affecting someone else's work life balance. Some people are ok with that, empathetic ones end up leaving or being the servant leaders and burning themselves out in order to shield others.  "
I would rate the job decent overall.                              Pay is ok, work is ok, benefits are ok, generally all ok. No pluses or minuses really. 
Great place to work-Learning opportunities, energy & fun, compensation, people & professionalism is what stands out. Great exposure. Great leaders. Great work culture
I did not like the culture at here. If you have the wrong accent or wrong nationality or wrong age, you will have a very difficult time working here. 
Prosflexible scheduleConssome days no breaks, favoritism, cliches and groups that run departments into the ground.
This job has great room for advancement, but management expects a lot. Also, not a good work life balance and there is an extremely competitive environment.
